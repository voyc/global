Louis Armstrong,"Louis Armstrong was the first important soloist to emerge in jazz, and he became the most influential musician in the music's history. As a trumpet virtuoso, his playing, beginning with the 1920s studio recordings made with his Hot Five and Hot Seven ensembles, charted a future for jazz in highly imaginative, emotionally charged improvisation. For this, he is revered by jazz fans. But Armstrong also became an enduring figure in popular music, due to his distinctively phrased bass singing and engaging personality, which were on display in a series of vocal recordings and film roles.","August 4, 1901","July 6, 1971","New Orleans, LA","Dixieland, Early Jazz, New Orleans Jazz, Vocal Jazz, Vocal, Swing, Traditional Pop, Jazz Instrument, Trumpet Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drP000/P007/P00735M9K4C.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kcftxqq5ld0e~T1
Count Basie,"Count Basie was among the most important bandleaders of the swing era. With the exception of a brief period in the early '50s, he led a big band from 1935 until his death almost 50 years later, and the band continued to perform after he died. Basie's orchestra was characterized by a light, swinging rhythm section that he led from the piano, lively ensemble work, and generous soloing. Basie was not a composer like Duke Ellington or an important soloist like Benny Goodman. His instrument was his band, which was considered the epitome of swing and became broadly influential on jazz.","August 21, 1904","April 26, 1984","Red Bank, NJ","Big Band, Blues, Piano Blues, Swing",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p028/p02821de8u7.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fifuxqt5ld6e~T1
John Coltrane,"Despite a relatively brief career (he first came to notice as a sideman at age 29 in 1955, formally launched a solo career at 33 in 1960, and was dead at 40 in 1967), saxophonist John Coltrane was among the most important, and most controversial, figures in jazz. It seems amazing that his period of greatest activity was so short, not only because he recorded prolifically, but also because, taking advantage of his fame, the record companies that recorded him as a sideman in the 1950s frequently reissued those recordings under his name and there has been a wealth of posthumously released material as well. Since Coltrane was a protean player who changed his style radically over the course of his career, this has made for much confusion in his discography and in appreciations of his playing. There remains a critical divide between the adherents of his earlier, more conventional (if still highly imaginative) work and his later, more experimental work. No one, however, questions Coltrane's almost religious commitment to jazz or doubts his significance in the history of the music.","September 23, 1926","July 17, 1967","Hamlet, NC","Post-Bop, Hard Bop, Free Jazz, Modal Music, Avant-Garde Jazz, Jazz Instrument, Saxophone Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp500/p541/p54116axkej.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:dvftxqr5ldfe~T1
Cannonball Adderley,"One of the great alto saxophonists, Cannonball Adderley had an exuberant and happy sound that communicated immediately to listeners.

Mose Allison,"Not unlike his namesake, Luther Allison, pianist Mose Allison has suffered from a ""categorization problem,"" given his equally brilliant career. Although his boogie-woogie and bebop-laden piano style is innovative and fresh sounding when it comes to blues and jazz, it is as a songwriter that Allison really shines. Allison's songs have been recorded by the Who (""Young Man Blues""), Leon Russell (""I'm Smashed""), and Bonnie Raitt (""Everybody's Cryin' Mercy""). Other admirers include Tom Waits, John Mayall, Georgie Fame, the Rolling Stones, and Van Morrison. But because he's always played both blues and jazz, and not one to the exclusion of the other, his career has suffered. As he himself admits, he has a ""category"" problem that lingers to this day. ""There's a lot of places I don't work because they're confused about what I do,"" he explained in a 1990 interview in Goldmine magazine. Despite the lingering confusion, Allison remains one of the finest songwriters in 20th century blues.

Chet Baker,"Chet Baker was a primary exponent of the West Coast school of cool jazz in the early and mid-'50s. As a trumpeter, he had a generally restrained, intimate playing style and he attracted attention beyond jazz for his photogenic looks and singing. But his career was marred by drug addiction.","December 23, 1929","May 13, 1988","Yale, OK","Cool, West Coast Jazz, Vocal Jazz, Jazz Instrument, Trumpet Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp400/p474/p47430mqrie.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wifrxqt5ld6e~T1
Art Blakey,"In the '60s, when John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman were defining the concept of a jazz avant-garde, few knowledgeable observers would have guessed that in another 30 years the music's mainstream would virtually bypass their innovations, in favor of the hard bop style that free jazz had apparently supplanted. As it turned out, many listeners who had come to love jazz as a sophisticated manifestation of popular music were unable to accept the extreme esotericism of the avant-garde; their tastes were rooted in the core elements of ""swing"" and ""blues,"" characteristics found in abundance in the music of the Jazz Messengers, the quintessential hard bop ensemble led by drummer Art Blakey. In the '60s, '70s, and '80s, when artists on the cutting edge were attempting to transform the music, Blakey continued to play in more or less the same bag he had since the '40s, when his cohorts included the likes of Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Fats Navarro. By the '80s, the evolving mainstream consensus had reached a point of overwhelming approval in regard to hard bop: this is what jazz is, and Art Blakey -- as its longest-lived and most eloquent exponent -- was its master.","October 11, 1919","October 16, 1990","Pittsburgh, PA","Hard Bop, Bop",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp400/p490/p49020ccteg.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:dcfoxqy5ldhe~T1
Anthony Braxton,"Genius is a rare commodity in any art form, but at the end of the 20th century it seemed all but non-existent in jazz, a music that had ceased looking ahead and begun swallowing its tail. If it seemed like the music had run out of ideas, it might be because Anthony Braxton covered just about every conceivable area of creativity during the course of his extraordinary career. The multi-reedist/composer might very well be jazz's last bona fide genius. Braxton began with jazz's essential rhythmic and textural elements, combining them with all manner of experimental compositional techniques, from graphic and non-specific notation to serialism and multimedia. Even at the peak of his renown in the mid- to late '70s, Braxton was a controversial figure amongst musicians and critics. His self-invented (yet heavily theoretical) approach to playing and composing jazz seemed to have as much in common with late 20th century classical music as it did jazz, and therefore alienated those who considered jazz at a full remove from European idioms. Although Braxton exhibited a genuine — if highly idiosyncratic — ability to play older forms (influenced especially by saxophonists Warne Marsh, John Coltrane, Paul Desmond, and Eric Dolphy), he was never really accepted by the jazz establishment, due to his manifest infatuation with the practices of such non-jazz artists as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Many of the mainstream's most popular musicians (Wynton Marsalis among them) insisted that Braxton's music was not jazz at all. Whatever one calls it, however, there is no questioning the originality of his vision; Anthony Braxton created music of enormous sophistication and passion that was unlike anything else that had come before it. Braxton was able to fuse jazz's visceral components with contemporary classical music's formal and harmonic methods in an utterly unselfconscious — and therefore convincing — way. The best of his work is on a level with any art music of the late 20th century, jazz or classical.","June 4, 1945",,"Chicago, IL","Free Jazz, Avant-Garde Jazz, Experimental Big Band, Avant-Garde,  Structured Improvisation, Creative Orchestra, Jazz Instrument, Saxophone Jazz, Classical",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p045/p04566e8u5c.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kifyxqt5ldhe~T1
Clifford Brown,"Clifford Brown's death in a car accident at the age of 25 was one of the great tragedies in jazz history. Already ranking with Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis as one of the top trumpeters in jazz, Brownie was still improving in 1956. Plus he was a clean liver and was not even driving; the up-and-coming pianist Richie Powell and his wife (who was driving) also perished in the crash.","October 30, 1930","June 26, 1956","Wilmington, DE","Bop, Hard Bop, Jazz Instrument, Trumpet Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp500/p539/p53903csnvg.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:jifixqt5ldhe~T1
"Oscar Brown, Jr.","Although rooted in jazz, singer, poet, and activist Oscar Brown, Jr. defied musical categorization throughout his long and eclectic career -- a forerunner of the political consciousness that would become predominant in soul, funk, and hip-hop in the decades to follow, his efforts to exact social change spread across the arts and even into government, spurring two unsuccessful but memorable campaigns for office. Born on Chicago's South Side on October 10, 1926, Brown was the son of a successful attorney and property broker who wanted his firstborn someday to assume control of the family business; instead, Brown was drawn to writing and performing, and by 15 was a regular on writer Studs Terkel's radio program Secret City. After skipping two grades, he entered the University of Wisconsin at 16, but finding the world of academia little to his liking, Brown returned to broadcasting, and in 1944 was tapped to host Negro Newsfront, the nation's first black news radio broadcast. Dubbed ""America's first Negro newscaster,"" he relinquished the gig in 1948 to run for the Illinois state legislature on the Progressive Party ticket -- he did not win, and spent the remainder of the decade working on writer/producer Richard Durham's Black Radio Days series, followed by a two-year stint in the U.S. Army.

Dave Brubeck,"Dave Brubeck has long served as proof that creative jazz and popular success can go together. Although critics who had championed him when he was unknown seemed to scorn him when the Dave Brubeck Quartet became a surprise success, in reality Brubeck never watered down or altered his music in order to gain a wide audience. Creative booking (being one of the first groups to play regularly on college campuses) and a bit of luck resulted in great popularity, and Dave Brubeck remains one of the few household names in jazz.","December 6, 1920",,"Concord, CA","Cool, West Coast Jazz, Jazz Instrument, Piano Jazz, Classical",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp500/p502/p50273nmwba.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aifoxqt5ldhe~T1
Donald Byrd,"Donald Byrd was considered one of the finest hard bop trumpeters of the post-Clifford Brown era. He recorded prolifically as both a leader and sideman from the mid-'50s into the mid-'60s, most often for Blue Note, where he established a reputation as a solid stylist with a clean tone, clear articulation, and a knack for melodicism. Toward the end of the '60s, Byrd became fascinated with Miles Davis' move into fusion, and started recording his own forays into the field. In the early '70s, with the help of brothers Larry and Fonce Mizell, Byrd perfected a bright, breezy, commercially potent take on fusion that was distinct from Davis, incorporating tighter arrangements and more of a smooth soul influence. Opinions on this phase of Byrd's career diverge wildly -- jazz purists utterly despised it, branding Byrd a sellout and the records a betrayal of talent, but enraptured jazz-funk fans regard it as some of the most innovative, enduring work of its kind. In fact, proportionately speaking, Byrd is held in even higher esteem by that audience than by straight-ahead jazz fans who enjoy his hard bop output.Donaldson Toussaint L'Ouverture Byrd II was born in Detroit, MI, on December 9, 1932. His father, a Methodist minister, was an amateur musician, and Byrd was already an accomplished trumpeter by the time he finished high school, having performed with Lionel Hampton. Byrd served a stint in the Air Force, during which time he played in a military band, and subsequently completed his bachelor's degree in music at Wayne State University in 1954. He moved to New York in 1955 to get his master's at the Manhattan School of Music, and soon began performing with pianist George Wallington's group. In December of that year, he was invited to join Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, filling a chair once held by his idol, Clifford Brown, and Kenny Dorham. Byrd also began his recording career during this period, leading several sessions (mostly for Savoy) and working often as a sideman, particularly at the Prestige label. He left the Jazz Messengers in 1956 and joined up with Max Roach; he went on to play with the likes of John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, and Red Garland, and also co-founded the Jazz Lab Quintet with altoist Gigi Gryce in 1957.In 1958, Byrd signed an exclusive recording contract with Blue Note, and also formed a band with baritonist Pepper Adams, who would remain Byrd's regular partner until 1961. Byrd's Blue Note debut was 1958's Off to the Races, and he and Adams collaborated on a series of excellent hard bop dates over the next three years, including Byrd in Hand (1959), At the Half Note Cafe, Vols. 1-2 (1960), The Cat Walk (1961), and Royal Flush (also 1961), among others. Another 1961 recording, Free Form, found Byrd giving a young Herbie Hancock some of his earliest exposure. Following this burst of activity, Byrd took a sabbatical to continue his studies in Europe, where he spent some time under the tutelage of the legendary French music educator Nadia Boulanger. He returned to the U.S. in 1963 and recorded A New Perspective, a now-classic set that broke new ground by incorporating gospel choirs into its arrangements; its signature piece, ""Cristo Redentor,"" became quite popular.In the mid-'60s, Byrd focused more of his energies on teaching, and worked diligently to make jazz and its history a legitimate part of the college curriculum. He taught at Rutgers, Hampton, New York University, and Howard in the late '60s, and the last one remained a steady association for much of the '70s. In the meantime, Byrd continued to record occasionally, cutting a final spate of hard bop albums over 1966-1967 that included Mustang! and Blackjack. Byrd also began to study African music, inspired partly by the emerging black-consciousness movement, and became interested in Miles Davis' efforts to woo a younger audience (including Byrd's own students) by experimenting with electronics and funk rhythms. 1969's Fancy Free found Byrd using electric piano for the first time, with a spacy sound that recalled Davis' In a Silent Way. 1970's Electric Byrd had more of a Bitches Brew flavor, and the jams on 1971's Ethiopian Knights were longer, funkier, and more aggressive. Byrd truly came into his own as a fusion artist when he hooked up with brothers Larry and Fonce Mizell, who began to handle production, writing, and some musical support duties. Their first collaboration was 1972's Black Byrd, an upbeat, funky blend of jazz and R&B. Jazz critics detested the album and called Byrd all sorts of names, but the record was a smash hit; it became the biggest seller in Blue Note history, and just missed hitting number one on the R&B albums chart. In the wake of its success, Byrd formed a supporting group, the Blackbyrds, who were culled from the cream of his music students at Howard University and recorded through the rest of the '70s. Byrd went on to release a string of successful LPs in partnership with the Mizell Brothers, including the imaginary blaxploitation soundtrack Street Lady (1974), Stepping into Tomorrow (1975), the much-lauded Places and Spaces (1976), and Caricatures (1977). All made the Top Ten on the R&B album charts, and the Places and Spaces single ""Change (Makes You Wanna Hustle)"" even got substantial play in discotheques. Jazz-funk fans revere this period in general, but usually reserve their highest praise for Street Lady and, especially, Places and Spaces. As a side note to his musical career, Byrd finished law school in 1976, and went on to teach at North Carolina Central University.Following Caricatures, Byrd parted ways with Blue Note and the Mizell Brothers and moved to Elektra. He recorded several albums over 1978-1983, but even the most commercially successful, 1978's Thank You...for F.U.M.L. (Funking up My Life), didn't match the infectiousness of his Blue Note jazz-funk outings. In 1982, Byrd received his Ph.D. from Columbia Teachers College. He spent a few years in the mid-'80s away from recording, due in part to ill health, but continued to teach, moving on to North Texas State and Delaware State. In the late '80s and early '90s, Byrd returned to the hard bop of his early days on several sessions for the Landmark label. He participated in rapper Guru's Jazzmatazz project in 1993, and with the advent of the jazz-rap movement and England's acid jazz revival, his '70s albums became hugely popular sources for samples. In the meantime, Byrd continued his activities as a jazz educator.","December 9, 1932",,"Detroit, MI","Funk, Jazz-Funk, Fusion, Hard Bop, Crossover Jazz, R&B, Post-Bop, Jazz Instrument, Trumpet Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp100/p112/p11280bje87.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:gvfexq95ldfe~T1
Charlie Christian,"It can be said without exaggeration that virtually every jazz guitarist that emerged during 1940-65 sounded like a relative of Charlie Christian. The first important electric guitarist, Christian played his instrument with the fluidity, confidence, and swing of a saxophonist. Although technically a swing stylist, his musical vocabulary was studied and emulated by the bop players, and when one listens to players ranging from Tiny Grimes, Barney Kessel, and Herb Ellis, to Wes Montgomery and George Benson, the dominant influence of Christian is obvious.","July 29, 1916","March 2, 1942","Dallas, TX","Swing, Bop, Big Band, Jazz Instrument, Guitar Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp300/p347/p34773dcbin.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kifuxqt5ldje~T1
Nat King Cole,"In the traditional pop market, Nat King Cole is best known for major pop hits like ""Mona Lisa"", ""Unforgettable,"" ""Too Young"" and ""Walkin' My Baby Back Home"". But Cole's roots were straightahead jazz, and before he was a pop superstar, he was a swing-oriented singer/pianist who had an improvising group that was billed as the Nat King Cole Trio. One thing that made the combo unique was the absence of a drummer; while about 98% of the small swing groups that were active in the ‘30s and ‘40s had full-time drummers, the Cole Trio only used piano, guitar and acoustic bass. Whether Cole was singing or favoring an instrumental approach, that piano/guitar/bass format was unique--and if the Nat King Cole Trio did work with a drummer, he was strictly a guest.","March 17, 1919","February 15, 1965","Montgomery, AL","Traditional Pop, Vocal Jazz, Vocal, Urban Blues, Swing, Jump Blues, Early R&B, R&B",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p075/p07584a13q7.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fvfrxqr5ldae~T1
Ornette Coleman,"One of the most important (and controversial) innovators of the jazz avant-garde, Ornette Coleman gained both loyal followers and lifelong detractors when he seemed to burst on the scene in 1959 fully formed. Although he, and Don Cherry in his original quartet, played opening and closing melodies together, their solos dispensed altogether with chordal improvisation and harmony, instead playing quite freely off of the mood of the theme. Coleman's tone (which purposely wavered in pitch) rattled some listeners, and his solos were emotional and followed their own logic. In time, his approach would be quite influential, and the quartet's early records still sound advanced many decades later.","March 9, 1930",,"Fort Worth, TX","Free Jazz, Free Funk, Modern Creative, Avant-Garde Jazz, Jazz Instrument, Saxophone Jazz, Fusion, Classical",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p062/p06262hh6t6.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:gvfpxqr5ldse~T1

Not content at any time to rest on his laurels, Corea has been involved in quite a few important musical projects, and his musical curiosity has never dimmed. A masterful pianist who, along with Herbie Hancock and Keith Jarrett, was one of the top stylists to emerge after Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, Corea is also one of the few electric keyboardists to be quite individual and recognizable on synthesizers.

Miles Davis,"Throughout a professional career lasting 50 years, Miles Davis played the trumpet in a lyrical, introspective, and melodic style, often employing a stemless Harmon mute to make his sound more personal and intimate. But if his approach to his instrument was constant, his approach to jazz was dazzlingly protean. To examine his career is to examine the history of jazz from the mid-'40s to the early '90s, since he was in the thick of almost every important innovation and stylistic development in the music during that period, and he often led the way in those changes, both with his own performances and recordings and by choosing sidemen and collaborators who forged new directions. It can even be argued that jazz stopped evolving when Davis wasn't there to push it forward.","May 26, 1926","September 28, 1991","Alton, IL","Pop/Rock, Jazz-Funk, Bop, Cool, Fusion, Hard Bop, Modal Music, Jazz-Rock, Post-Bop, Jazz Instrument, Trumpet Jazz, Classical",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp100/p118/p11854a52w5.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0ifuxqt5ldke~T1
Eric Dolphy,"Eric Dolphy was a true original with his own distinctive styles on alto, flute, and bass clarinet. His music fell into the ""avant-garde"" category yet he did not discard chordal improvisation altogether (although the relationship of his notes to the chords was often pretty abstract). While most of the other ""free jazz"" players sounded very serious in their playing, Dolphy's solos often came across as ecstatic and exuberant. His improvisations utilized very wide intervals, a variety of nonmusical speechlike sounds, and its own logic. Although the alto was his main axe, Dolphy was the first flutist to move beyond bop (influencing James Newton) and he largely introduced the bass clarinet to jazz as a solo instrument. He was also one of the first (after Coleman Hawkins) to record unaccompanied horn solos, preceding Anthony Braxton by five years.","June 20, 1928","June 29, 1964","Los Angeles, CA","Post-Bop, Free Jazz, Avant-Garde Jazz, Jazz Instrument, Saxophone Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp500/p507/p50703vjpug.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hifqxqt5ld0e~T1
Tommy Dorsey,"Though he might have been ranked second at any given moment to Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, or Harry James, Tommy Dorsey was overall the most popular bandleader of the swing era that lasted from 1935 to 1945. His remarkably melodic trombone playing was the signature sound of his orchestra, but he successfully straddled the hot and sweet styles of swing with a mix of ballads and novelty songs. He provided showcases to vocalists like Frank Sinatra, Dick Haymes, and Jo Stafford, and he employed inventive arrangers such as Sy Oliver and Bill Finegan. He was the biggest-selling artist in the history of RCA Victor Records, one of the major labels, until the arrival of Elvis Presley, who was first given national exposure on the 1950s television show he hosted with his brother Jimmy. Dorsey was 21 months younger than Jimmy and thus the second son of Thomas Francis Dorsey, Sr., a music teacher and band director, and Theresa Langton Dorsey. Both brothers received musical instruction from their father. Tommy focused on the trombone, though he also played trumpet, especially early in his career. The brothers played in local groups, then formed their own band, Dorsey's Novelty Six, in 1920. By 1922, when they played an engagement at a Baltimore amusement park and made their radio debut, they were calling the group Dorsey's Wild Canaries. During the early and mid-'20s, they played in a series of bands including the Scranton Sirens, the California Ramblers, and orchestras led by Jean Goldkette and Paul Whiteman, sometimes apart, but usually together. Eventually, they settled in New York and worked as session musicians. In 1927, they began recording as the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra for OKeh Records, using pickup bands, and they first reached the charts with ""Coquette"" in June 1928. In the spring of 1929, they scored a Top Ten hit with ""Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love),"" which featured Bing Crosby on vocals. The Dorseys finally organized a full-time band and signed to Decca Records in 1934. Hiring Bing Crosby's younger brother Bob Crosby as their vocalist, they scored a Top Ten hit with ""I Believe in Miracles"" in the late winter of 1935, quickly followed by ""Tiny Little Fingerprints"" (vocal by Kay Weber) and ""Night Wind"" (vocal by Bob Crosby). They then enjoyed successive number one hits with ""Lullaby of Broadway"" (vocal by Bob Crosby) and ""Chasing Shadows"" (vocal by Bob Eberly, Bob Crosby's replacement). The Dorsey Brothers Orchestra was poised to become the biggest band in the country in the spring of 1935 and might have been remembered for launching the swing era, but at the end of May the brothers, whose relationship was always volatile, disagreed, and Tommy left the band (which nevertheless scored another Top Ten hit with ""Every Little Movement"" that summer). Jimmy Dorsey continued to lead the band, which eventually was billed as Jimmy Dorsey and His Orchestra and went on to considerable success. But while the Dorseys stumbled, Benny Goodman achieved national success and was dubbed ""the King of Swing."" Tommy Dorsey took over the remnants of the Joe Haymes band in founding his own orchestra in the fall of 1935. Signing to RCA Victor Records, he scored an immediate success with ""On Treasure Island"" (vocal by Edythe Wright), which topped the charts in December 1935, one of four Dorsey records to peak in the Top Ten before the end of the year. Dorsey was back at number one in January 1936 with ""The Music Goes Round and Round"" (vocal by Edythe Wright) and topped the charts again in February with ""Alone"" (vocal by Cliff Weston). ""You"" (vocal by Edythe Wright) gave him his third number one in 1936, to which can be added eight other Top Ten hits during the year. Dorsey was even more successful in 1937, a year in which he scored 18 Top Ten hits, among them the chart-toppers ""Marie"" (vocal by Jack Leonard), ""Satan Takes a Holiday"" (an instrumental), ""The Big Apple,"" ""Once in a While,"" and ""The Dipsy Doodle"" (vocal by Edythe Wright). Dorsey earned his own radio series, which ran for nearly three years. His 15 Top Ten hits in 1938 included the number one ""Music, Maestro, Please"" (vocal by Edythe Wright), and he had another 11 Top Ten hits in 1939, among them ""Our Love"" (vocal by Jack Leonard), which hit number one. Notwithstanding his commercial success, Dorsey made important changes in his band in late 1939, particularly in his vocalists. Jack Leonard left the band in November, and Dorsey hired Frank Sinatra away from Harry James. Longtime female singer Edythe Wright also departed, replaced by Connie Haines, and the vocal quartet the Pied Pipers, featuring Jo Stafford, also joined Dorsey. The success only continued with the new members. Dorsey scored ten Top Ten hits in 1940, among them the chart-toppers ""Indian Summer"" and ""All the Things You Are"" (both with vocals by Leonard) as well as ""I'll Never Smile Again"" (with vocals by Sinatra and the Pied Pipers). For the year, he ranked second behind Glenn Miller as the top recording artist. He dropped to third place behind Miller and his brother Jimmy in 1941, a year in which he scored another ten Top Ten hits, eight of them featuring Sinatra, including the number one hit ""Dolores"" from the film Las Vegas Nights, released in March, in which the band appeared. 1942 was a challenging year for Dorsey. The U.S. had entered World War II in December 1941, which put pressure on the big bands particularly in terms of changing personnel and travel difficulties. On August 1, 1942, the American Federation of Musicians called a strike that prevented musicians from entering recording studios. Frank Sinatra left the band in September to launch a solo career, and the Pied Pipers were gone by the end of the year. Nevertheless, Dorsey carried on, putting the band into a second motion picture, Ship Ahoy, which opened in June, and scoring four Top Ten hits, which, with his other chart entries, was enough to rank him fifth among the year's top recording artists. He earned the same ranking in the transitional year of 1943, despite being shut out of the recording studios, managing another four Top Ten hits, among them ""There Are Such Things"" and ""In the Blue of the Evening,"" chart-toppers Sinatra recorded with the band before his departure. Meanwhile, Dorsey turned to film roles to keep active, appearing in three movies released during 1943: Presenting Lily Mars, DuBarry Was a Lady, and Girl Crazy. By 1944, RCA Victor had exhausted its stockpile of unissued Dorsey recordings and had to resort to reissues, managing Top Ten hits with the 1938 instrumental ""Boogie Woogie"" and the 1940 recording ""I'll Be Seeing You"" with Sinatra on vocals. Dorsey remained in Hollywood, appearing in Broadway Rhythm, which opened in April. The settlement of the musicians' union strike in the fall allowed him to return to the recording studio, and he scored six Top Ten hits in 1945 as a result, also placing an album, Getting Sentimental, in the newly instituted album charts. In May, he appeared in the film Thrill of a Romance. Dorsey scored another Top Ten album with Show Boat, containing songs from the Broadway musical, in February 1946. The big bands were in decline, and like some of his peers, Dorsey broke up his band in December 1946. But his All-Time Hits was in the Top Ten of the album charts in February 1947, and in March ""How Are Things in Glocca Morra?"" (vocal by Stuart Foster) entered the singles charts to become a Top Ten hit. Dorsey reorganized his band, and in May he played himself in a largely fictionalized film biography, The Fabulous Dorseys. Clambake Seven, an album of music by Dorsey's small group, reached the Top Ten in October 1948, the same month he appeared in the film A Song Is Born, and the following month he was back in the Top Ten of the singles charts with ""Until"" (vocal by Harry Prime). In the spring of 1949, he had a double-sided Top Ten hit with ""The Hucklebuck"" (vocal by Charlie Shavers)/""Again"" (vocal by Marcy Lutes). The compilation album And the Band Sings Too was in the Top Ten in September, and Dorsey returned to the Top Ten of the album charts with Tommy Dorsey Plays Cole Porter in April 1950. His final film appearance came in Disc Jockey in September 1951. Dorsey switched to Decca Records and continued to perform with his band in the early '50s. In May 1953, Jimmy Dorsey broke up his band and joined his brother's orchestra as a featured attraction; before long, the band was again being billed as the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra. While playing a residency at the Statler Hilton Hotel in New York, the brothers launched a television series, Stage Show, as a summer replacement program in the summer of 1954. It returned on an occasional basis during the 1954-1955 season and ran regularly once a week during the 1955-1956 season. Elvis Presley appeared on the show for six consecutive weeks starting in January 1956, his first nationally broadcast appearances. Sedated by sleeping pills following a heavy meal, Dorsey accidentally choked to death at the age of 51. His brother led his band briefly afterward, but Jimmy Dorsey died in 1957. Nevertheless, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra continued to record and perform, and under the direction of Warren Covington it scored a final million-selling Top Ten hit in November 1958 with ""Tea for Two Cha Cha."" Billed as ""the sentimental gentleman of swing,"" Tommy Dorsey successfully combined the hot and sweet aspects of swing music while leading a band that consistently ranked among the top two or three orchestras in the U.S. from the mid-'30s to the mid-'40s, the entire swing era. His band was peopled with major jazz instrumentalists (including Bunny Berigan, Ziggy Elman, Pee Wee Erwin, Max Kaminsky, Buddy Rich, Charlie Shavers, and Dave Tough), arrangers (including Sy Oliver and Paul Weston), and singers (including Frank Sinatra and Jo Stafford) who went on to define popular music in the late '40s and early '50s. He was also an accomplished trombone player whose distinctive sound dominated his band and recordings. The bulk of those recordings were made for RCA Victor, though some later work was done for Decca and Columbia, and of course there are numerous airchecks, making for a large discography.","November 19, 1905","November 26, 1956","Shenandoah, PA","Big Band, Swing, Sweet Bands",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p073/p07319o6531.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kbfwxql5ldfe~T1
Dave Douglas,"Dave Douglas arguably became the most original trumpeter/composer of his generation. Douglas' stylistic range is broad yet unaffected; his music is not a pastiche, but rather a personal aesthetic that reflects a wide variety of interests. He explicitly cites such diverse influences as Igor Stravinsky, Stevie Wonder, and John Coltrane. As a composer, Douglas adapts and synthesizes unusual forms and creates his own out of disparate elements. As a trumpeter, Douglas possesses a comprehensive jazz technique; certainly, one hears the ghost of Lester Bowie in Douglas' expressive manipulations of timbre and pitch, but more pronounced is the integration of distinctive compositional and improvisational conceptions that ultimately defines his work.","March 24, 1963",,"Montclair, NJ","Modern Creative, Avant-Garde Jazz, Post-Bop, Jazz Instrument, Trumpet Jazz, Classical",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp200/p231/p23191wbhar.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:abfqxql5ldte~T1
Duke Ellington,"Duke Ellington was the most important composer in the history of jazz as well as being a bandleader who held his large group together continuously for almost 50 years. The two aspects of his career were related; Ellington used his band as a musical laboratory for his new compositions and shaped his writing specifically to showcase the talents of his bandmembers, many of whom remained with him for long periods. Ellington also wrote film scores and stage musicals, and several of his instrumental works were adapted into songs that became standards. In addition to touring year in and year out, he recorded extensively, resulting in a gigantic body of work that was still being assessed a quarter century after his death.","Apr 29, 1899 ","May 24, 1974",Washington D.C.,"Big Band, Swing, Early Jazz, Standards, Film Music, Modern Big Band,Progressive Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp200/p215/p21595d0mv1.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fbfexqq5ldae~T1
Bill Evans,"With the passage of time, Bill Evans has become an entire school unto himself for pianists and a singular mood unto himself for listeners. There is no more influential jazz-oriented pianist -- only McCoy Tyner exerts nearly as much pull among younger players and journeymen -- and Evans has left his mark on such noted players as Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Brad Mehldau. Borrowing heavily from the impressionism of Debussy and Ravel, Evans brought a new, introverted, relaxed, lyrical, European classical sensibility into jazz -- and that seems to have attracted a lot of young conservatory-trained pianists who follow his chord voicings to the letter in clubs and on stages everywhere. Indeed, classical pianists like Jean-Yves Thibaudet have recorded note-for-note transcriptions of Evans' performances, bringing out the direct lineage with classical composers. In interviews, Evans often stressed that pianists should thoroughly learn technique and harmony so that they can put their inspiration to maximum use. Since he already had those tools in hand, he worked very hard on his touch, getting the special, refined tone that he wanted out of a piano. He also tried to democratize the role of the bassist and drummer in his succession of piano trios, encouraging greater contrapuntal interplay.","August 16, 1929","September 15, 1980","Plainfield, NJ","Cool, Post-Bop, Modal Music, Jazz Instrument, Piano Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp500/p513/p51339qvrve.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0ifuxqt5ld0e~T1
Gil Evans,"One of the most significant arrangers in jazz history, Gil Evans' three album-length collaborations with Miles Davis (Miles Ahead, Porgy and Bess, and Sketches of Spain) are all considered classics. Evans had a lengthy and wide-ranging career that sometimes ran parallel to the trumpeter. Like Davis, Gil became involved in utilizing electronics in the '70s and preferred not to look back and re-create the past. He led his own band in California (1933-1938) which eventually became the backup group for Skinnay Ennis; Evans stayed on for a time as arranger. He gained recognition for his somewhat futuristic charts for Claude Thornhill's Orchestra (1941-1942 and 1946-1948) which took advantage of the ensemble's cool tones, utilized French horns and a tuba as frontline instruments, and, by 1946, incorporated the influence of bop. He met Miles Davis (who admired his work with Thornhill) during this time and contributed arrangements of ""Moon Dreams"" and ""Boplicity"" to Davis' ""Birth of the Cool"" nonet.","May 13, 1912","March 20, 1988","Toronto, Ontario, Canada","Cool, Fusion, Post-Bop, Modern Big Band, Progressive Jazz,  Experimental Big Band",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p092/p09203nw5cy.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wbfuxqe5ldae~T1
Ella Fitzgerald,"""The First Lady of Song,"" Ella Fitzgerald was arguably the finest female jazz singer of all time (although some may vote for Sarah Vaughan or Billie Holiday). Blessed with a beautiful voice and a wide range, Fitzgerald could outswing anyone, was a brilliant scat singer, and had near-perfect elocution; one could always understand the words she sang. The one fault was that, since she always sounded so happy to be singing, Fitzgerald did not always dig below the surface of the lyrics she interpreted and she even made a downbeat song such as ""Love for Sale"" sound joyous. However, when one evaluates her career on a whole, there is simply no one else in her class.","April 25, 1917","June 15, 1996","Newport News, VA","Jazz, Bop, Swing, Standards, Traditional Pop, Vocal Jazz, Popular Music Entry",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p006/p00650nc896.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:gifpxqt5ldae~T1
Red Garland,"Red Garland mixed together the usual influences of his generation (Nat Cole, Bud Powell, and Ahmad Jamal) into his own distinctive approach; Garland's block chords themselves became influential on the players of the 1960s. He started out playing clarinet and alto, switching to piano when he was 18. During 1946-1955, he worked steadily in New York and Philadelphia, backing such major players as Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, and Roy Eldridge, but still remaining fairly obscure. That changed when he became a member of the classic Miles Davis Quintet (1955-1958), heading a rhythm section that also included Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones. After leaving Miles, Garland had his own popular trio and recorded very frequently for Prestige, Jazzland, and Moodsville during 1956-1962 (the majority of which are available in the Original Jazz Classics series). The pianist eventually returned to Texas and was in semi-retirement, but came back gradually in the 1970s, recording for MPS (1971) and Galaxy (1977-1979) before retiring again.","May 13, 1923","April 23, 1984","Dallas, TX","Hard Bop, Jazz Instrument, Piano Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p006/p00631b4qs1.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0iftxqt5ldae
Erroll Garner,"One of the most distinctive of all pianists, Erroll Garner proved that it was possible to be a sophisticated player without knowing how to read music, that a creative jazz musician can be very popular without watering down his music, and that it is possible to remain an enthusiastic player without changing one's style once it is formed. A brilliant virtuoso who sounded unlike anyone else, on medium tempo pieces, Erroll Garner often stated the beat with his left hand like a rhythm guitar while his right played chords slightly behind the beat, creating a memorable effect. His playful free-form introductions (which forced his sidemen to really listen), his ability to play stunning runs without once glancing at the keyboard, his grunting, and the pure joy that he displayed while performing were also part of the Erroll Garner magic.","June 15, 1921","January 7, 1977","Pittsburgh, PA","Bop, Swing, Jazz Instrument, Piano Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp500/p552/p55219lw2zo.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aiftxqt5ldae~T1
Stan Getz,"One of the all-time great tenor saxophonists, Stan Getz was known as ""The Sound"" because he had one of the most beautiful tones ever heard. Getz, whose main early influence was Lester Young, grew to be a major influence himself and to his credit he never stopped evolving.","February 2, 1927","June 6, 1991","Philadelphia, PA","International, Bossa Nova, West Coast Jazz, Brazilian Traditions, Cool, Hard Bop, Jazz Instrument, Saxophone Jazz, Post-Bop",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp100/p173/p17375tv3v8.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aifyxqt5ldae~T1
Dizzy Gillespie,"Dizzy Gillespie's contributions to jazz were huge. One of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time (some would say the best), Gillespie was such a complex player that his contemporaries ended up copying Miles Davis and Fats Navarro instead, and it was not until Jon Faddis' emergence in the 1970s that Dizzy's style was successfully recreated. Somehow, Gillespie could make any ""wrong"" note fit, and harmonically he was ahead of everyone in the 1940s, including Charlie Parker. Unlike Bird, Dizzy was an enthusiastic teacher who wrote down his musical innovations and was eager to explain them to the next generation, thereby insuring that bebop would eventually become the foundation of jazz.","October 21, 1917","January 6, 1993","Cheraw, SC","World Fusion, Bop, Afro-Cuban Jazz, Vocal Jazz, Big Band, Jazz Instrument, Trumpet Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p009/p00924t01k4.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kifuxqt5ldae~T1
Benny Goodman,"Benny Goodman was the first celebrated bandleader of the Swing Era, dubbed ""The King of Swing,"" his popular emergence marking the beginning of the era. He was an accomplished clarinetist whose distinctive playing gave an identity both to his big band and to the smaller units he led simultaneously. The most popular figure of the first few years of the Swing Era, he continued to perform until his death 50 years later.","May 30, 1909","June 13, 1986","Chicago, IL","Big Band, Swing, Sweet Bands, Classical",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp200/p276/p27661ojapw.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:jifoxqt5ldae~T1
Dexter Gordon,"Dexter Gordon had such a colorful and eventful life (with three separate comebacks) that his story would make a great Hollywood movie. The top tenor saxophonist to emerge during the bop era and possessor of his own distinctive sound, Gordon sometimes was long-winded and quoted excessively from other songs, but he created a large body of superior work and could battle nearly anyone successfully at a jam session. His first important gig was with Lionel Hampton (1940-1943) although, due to Illinois Jacquet also being in the sax section, Gordon did not get any solos. In 1943, he did get to stretch out on a recording session with Nat King Cole. Short stints with Lee Young, the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, and Louis Armstrong's big band preceded his move to New York in December 1944 and becoming part of Billy Eckstine's Orchestra, trading off with Gene Ammons on Eckstine's recording of ""Blowin' the Blues Away."" Gordon recorded with Dizzy Gillespie (""Blue 'N' Boogie"") and as a leader for Savoy before returning to Los Angeles in the summer of 1946. He was a major part of the Central Avenue scene, trading off with Wardell Gray and Teddy Edwards in many legendary tenor battles; studio recordings of ""The Chase"" and ""The Duel"" helped to document the atmosphere of the period.","February 27, 1923","April 25, 1990","Los Angeles, CA","Bop, Hard Bop, Jazz Instrument, Saxophone Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p051/p05147f2q1k.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:difpxqt5ldse~T1
Stéphane Grappelli,"One of the all-time great jazz violinists (ranking with Joe Venuti and Stuff Smith as one of the big three of pre-bop), Stéphane Grappelli's longevity and consistently enthusiastic playing did a great deal to establish the violin as a jazz instrument. He was originally self-taught as both a violinist and a pianist, although during 1924-28 he studied at the Paris Conservatoire. Grappelli played in movie theaters and dance bands before meeting guitarist Django Reinhardt in 1933. They hit it off musically from the start even though their lifestyles (Grappelli was sophisticated while Django was a gypsy) were very different. Together as Quintet of the Hot Club of France (comprised of violin, three acoustic guitars and bass) during 1933-39 they produced a sensational series of recordings and performances. During a London engagement in 1939, World War II broke out. Reinhardt rashly decided to return to France but Grappelli stayed in England, effectively ending the group. The violinist soon teamed up with the young pianist George Shearing in a new band that worked steadily through the war. In 1946, Grappelli and Reinhardt had the first of several reunions although they never worked together again on a regular basis (despite many new recordings). Grappelli performed throughout the 1950s and '60s in clubs throughout Europe and, other than recordings with Duke Ellington (Violin Summit) and Joe Venuti, he remained somewhat obscure in the U.S. until he began regularly touring the world in the early '70s. Since then Grappelli has been a constant traveler and a consistent poll-winner, remaining very open-minded without altering his swing style; he has recorded with David Grisman, Earl Hines, Bill Coleman, Larry Coryell, Oscar Peterson, Jean Luc Ponty and McCoy Tyner among many others. Active up until near the end, the increasingly frail Grappelli remained at the top of his field even when he was 89. His early recordings are all available on Classics CDs and he recorded quite extensively during his final three decades.","January 26, 1908","December 1, 1997","Paris, France","Swing,Continental Jazz, Jazz Instrument, Guitar Jazz, Piano Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp500/p509/p50988qwsew.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aifpxqt5ldse~T1
Grant Green,"Grant Green was born in St. Louis on June 6, 1931, learned his instrument in grade school from his guitar-playing father and was playing professionally by the age of thirteen with a gospel group. He worked gigs in his home town and in East St. Louis, IL, until he moved to New York in 1960 at the suggestion of Lou Donaldson. Green told Dan Morgenstern in a Down Beat interview: ""The first thing I learned to play was boogie-woogie. Then I had to do a lot of rock & roll. It's all blues, anyhow.""","June 6, 1931","January 31, 1979","St. Louis, MO","Soul Jazz, Hard Bop, Jazz Instrument, Guitar Jazz, Jazz-Funk",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp100/p182/p18228pw1er.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wifqxqt5ldse~T1
Herbie Hancock,"Herbie Hancock will always be one of the most revered and controversial figures in jazz -- just as his employer/mentor Miles Davis was when he was alive. Unlike Miles, who pressed ahead relentlessly and never looked back until near the very end, Hancock has cut a zigzagging forward path, shuttling between almost every development in electronic and acoustic jazz and R&B over the last third of the 20th century. Though grounded in Bill Evans and able to absorb blues, funk, gospel, and even modern classical influences, Hancock's piano and keyboard voices are entirely his own, with their own urbane harmonic and complex, earthy rhythmic signatures -- and young pianists cop his licks constantly. Having studied engineering and professing to love gadgets and buttons, Hancock was perfectly suited for the electronic age; he was one of the earliest champions of the Rhodes electric piano and Hohner clavinet and would field an ever-growing collection of synthesizers and computers on his electric dates. Yet his love for the grand piano never waned, and despite his peripatetic activities all around the musical map, his piano style continues to evolve into tougher, ever-more-complex forms. He is as much at home trading riffs with a smoking funk band as he is communing with a world-class post-bop rhythm section -- and that drives purists on both sides of the fence up the wall.","April 12, 1940",,"Chicago, IL","Funk, Jazz-Funk, Fusion, Post-Bop, Hard Bop, Modal Music, Electro, Electronic, R&B, Jazz Instrument, Piano Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p008/p00864jt79s.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kiftxqt5ldse~T1
Coleman Hawkins,"Coleman Hawkins was the first important tenor saxophonist and he remains one of the greatest of all time. A consistently modern improviser whose knowledge of chords and harmonies was encyclopedic, Hawkins had a 40-year prime (1925-1965) during which he could hold his own with any competitor.","November 21, 1904","May 19, 1969","St. Joseph, MO","Bop, Swing, Early Jazz,Mainstream Jazz, Jazz Instrument, Saxophone Jazz, Big Band",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp300/p349/p34952sipre.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wpfixqr5ld0e~T1
Billie Holiday,"The first popular jazz singer to move audiences with the intense, personal feeling of classic blues, Billie Holiday changed the art of American pop vocals forever. Almost fifty years after her death, it's difficult to believe that prior to her emergence, jazz and pop singers were tied to the Tin Pan Alley tradition and rarely personalized their songs; only blues singers like Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey actually gave the impression they had lived through what they were singing. Billie Holiday's highly stylized reading of this blues tradition revolutionized traditional pop, ripping the decades-long tradition of song plugging in two by refusing to compromise her artistry for either the song or the band. She made clear her debts to Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong (in her autobiography she admitted, ""I always wanted Bessie's big sound and Pops' feeling""), but in truth her style was virtually her own, quite a shock in an age of interchangeable crooners and band singers.","April 7, 1915","July 17, 1959","Philadelphia, PA","Blues, Classic Female Blues, Jazz, Torch Songs, Swing, Traditional Pop, Vocal Jazz, Standards",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp200/p216/p21647bq10w.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kcfqxqt5ldde~T1
Dave Holland,"Dave Holland is of a generation of bassists who, in the '60s and '70s, built upon the innovations of slightly older players like Scott LaFaro, Gary Peacock, and Barre Phillips, carrying the instrument to yet another new level of creativity. Along with contemporaries like Eddie Gómez, Miroslav Vitous, and Barry Guy, Holland helped refine and extend the melodic possibilities of the cumbersome double bass. In Holland's case, those refinements never lost touch with the core verities of straight-ahead jazz; Holland's sense of swing is unexcelled. Additionally, Holland is possibly the most accomplished pure jazz composer among bassists, after Charles Mingus. Holland's small groups in the '80s and '90s, while working firmly within the jazz idiom, presented a fresh alternative to the fusty re-creations of the neo-boppers.","October 1, 1946",,"Wolverhampton, England","Post-Bop, Free Jazz, Avant-Garde Jazz, M-Base, Modern Creative, Jazz Instrument, Piano Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p005/p00585xtj6y.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0iftxqt5ldde~T1
Freddie Hubbard,"One of the great jazz trumpeters of all time, Freddie Hubbard formed his sound out of the Clifford Brown/Lee Morgan tradition, and by the early '70s was immediately distinctive and the pacesetter in jazz. However, a string of blatantly commercial albums later in the decade damaged his reputation and, just when Hubbard, in the early '90s (with the deaths of Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis), seemed perfectly suited for the role of veteran master, his chops started causing him serious troubles.","April 7, 1938","December 29, 2008","Indianapolis, IN","Jazz-Funk, Soul Jazz, Fusion, Post-Bop, Hard Bop, Jazz Instrument,  Trumpet Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp400/p489/p48971ymavl.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0nfyxqr5ldae~T1
Bobby Hutcherson,"Easily one of jazz's greatest vibraphonists, Bobby Hutcherson epitomized his instrument in relation to the era in which he came of age the way Lionel Hampton did with swing or Milt Jackson with bop. He isn't as well-known as those two forebears, perhaps because he started out in less-accessible territory when he emerged in the '60s playing cerebral, challenging modern jazz that often bordered on avant-garde. Along with Gary Burton, the other seminal vibraphone talent of the '60s, Hutcherson helped modernize his instrument by redefining what could be done with it -- sonically, technically, melodically, and emotionally. In the process, he became one of the defining (if underappreciated) voices in the so-called ""new thing"" portion of Blue Note's glorious '60s roster. Hutcherson gradually moved into a more mainstream, modal post-bop style that, if not as adventurous as his early work, still maintained his reputation as one of the most advanced masters of his instrument.","January 27, 1941",,"Los Angeles, CA","Post-Bop, Hard Bop, Modern Creative, Mainstream Jazz, Progressive Jazz, Jazz Instrument, Vibraphone/ Marimba Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp100/p136/p13618cx98i.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0nfpxqu5ldke~T1
Milt Jackson,"Before Milt Jackson, there were only two major vibraphonists: Lionel Hampton and Red Norvo. Jackson soon surpassed both of them in significance and, despite the rise of other players (including Bobby Hutcherson and Gary Burton), still won the popularity polls throughout the decades. Jackson (or ""Bags"" as he was long called) was at the top of his field for 50 years, playing bop, blues, and ballads with equal skill and sensitivity.","January 1, 1923","October 9, 1999","Detroit, MI","Vocal, Bop, Post-Bop, Hard Bop, Modern Big Band, Mainstream Jazz, Standards, Chamber Jazz, Third Stream, Jazz Instrument, Vibraphone/ Marimba Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p014/p01437rv2yo.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:jifoxqt5ldde~T1

Keith Jarrett,"One of the most significant pianists to emerge since the 1960s, Keith Jarrett maintained a career that went through several phases. He gained international fame for his solo concerts, which found him spontaneously improvising all of the music without any prior planning, but he also led a couple of dynamic quartets/quintets, performed classical music, and later played explorative versions of standards with his longtime trio. Although his tendency to ""sing along"" with his piano now and then is distracting, Jarrett continued to grow as a powerful improviser after decades of important accomplishments.","May 8, 1945",,"Allentown, PA","Modern Creative, Fusion, Post-Bop, Contemporary Jazz, Vocal, Mainstream Jazz, Progressive Jazz, Standards, Jazz Instrument, Piano Jazz, Classical",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp400/p479/p47950pnrmr.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hifpxqt5ldfe~T1
James P. Johnson,"One of the great jazz pianists of all time, James P. Johnson was the king of stride pianists in the 1920s. He began working in New York clubs as early as 1913 and was quickly recognized as the pacesetter. In 1917, Johnson began making piano rolls. Duke Ellington learned from these (by slowing them down to half-speed), and a few years later, Johnson became Fats Waller's teacher and inspiration. During the '20s (starting in 1921), Johnson began to record, he was the nightly star at Harlem rent parties (accompanied by Waller and Willie ""The Lion"" Smith) and he wrote some of his most famous compositions during this period. For the 1923 Broadway show Running Wild (one of his dozen scores), Johnson composed ""The Charleston"" and ""Old Fashioned Love,"" his earlier piano feature ""Carolina Shout"" became the test piece for other pianists, and some of his other songs included ""If I Could Be with You One Hour Tonight"" and ""A Porter's Love Song to a Chambermaid.""","Feb 1, 1894","November 17, 1955","New Brunswick, NJ","Ragtime, Stride, Early Jazz, Jazz Instrument, Piano Jazz, Classical",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp300/p300/p30033srhnu.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0ifexqt5ldfe~T1

Stan Kenton,"There have been few jazz musicians as consistently controversial as Stan Kenton. Dismissed by purists of various genres while loved by many others, Kenton ranks up there with Chet Baker and Sun Ra as jazz's top cult figure. He led a succession of highly original bands that often emphasized emotion, power, and advanced harmonies over swing, and this upset listeners who felt that all big bands should aim to sound like Count Basie. Kenton always had a different vision.","December 15, 1911","August 25, 1979","Wichita, KS","Big Band, Vocal, Progressive Jazz, Traditional Pop",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp400/p479/p47987jfppk.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kifixqt5ldfe~T1
Rahsaan Roland Kirk,"Arguably the most exciting saxophone soloist in jazz history, Kirk was a post-modernist before that term even existed. Kirk played the continuum of jazz tradition as an instrument unto itself; he felt little compunction about mixing and matching elements from the music's history, and his concoctions usually seemed natural, if not inevitable. When discussing Kirk, a great deal of attention is always paid to his eccentricities -- playing several horns at once, making his own instruments, clowning on stage. However, Kirk was an immensely creative artist; perhaps no improvising saxophonist has ever possessed a more comprehensive technique -- one that covered every aspect of jazz, from Dixieland to free -- and perhaps no other jazz musician has ever been more spontaneously inventive. His skills in constructing a solo are of particular note. Kirk had the ability to pace, shape, and elevate his improvisations to an extraordinary degree. During any given Kirk solo, just at the point in the course of his performance when it appeared he could not raise the intensity level any higher, he always seemed able to turn it up yet another notch.","August 7, 1936","December 5, 1977","Columbus, OH","Post-Bop, Avant-Garde Jazz, Modern Creative, Soul Jazz, Mainstream Jazz, Jazz Instrument, Saxophone Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp400/p479/p47951ifivz.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aifoxqt5ldfe~T1
Mahavishnu Orchestra,"One of the premiere fusion groups, the Mahavishnu Orchestra were considered by most observers during their prime to be a rock band, but their sophisticated improvisations actually put their high-powered music between rock and jazz. Founder and leader John McLaughlin had recently played with Miles Davis and Tony Williams' Lifetime. The original lineup of the group was McLaughlin on electric guitar, violinist Jerry Goodman, keyboardist Jan Hammer, electric bassist Rick Laird, and drummer Billy Cobham. They recorded three intense albums for Columbia during 1971-1973 and then the personnel changed completely for the second version of the group. In 1974, the band consisted of violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, Gayle Moran on keyboards and vocals, electric bassist Ralphe Armstrong, and drummer Narada Michael Walden; by 1975 Stu Goldberg had replaced Moran and Ponty had left. John McLaughlin's dual interests in Eastern religion and playing acoustic guitar resulted in the band breaking up in 1975. Surprisingly, an attempt to revive the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1984 (using Cobham, saxophonist Bill Evans, keyboardist Mitchell Forman, electric bassist Jonas Hellborg, and percussionist Danny Gottlieb) was unsuccessful; one Warner Bros. album resulted. However, when one thinks of the Mahavishnu Orchestra, it is of the original lineup, which was very influential throughout the 1970s.",1971,,,"Pop/Rock, Fusion, Jazz-Rock",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp200/p227/p22733wbhar.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:gifwxqy5ld6e~T1

Sotiria Bellou,"Sotiria Bellou was one of the most influential singers of rembetika tragoudi, a style of song known as ""Greek blues."" ""Discovered"" by late Greek composer Vassilis Tsitsánis in 1945, Bellou continued to sing professionally for nearly five decades. Supporting herself during rembetika's popularity lull of the 1950s by selling cassettes on the street, she regained her former status during the rembetika revival that extended from the mid-'60s until the early '80s. A native of Drosia (now Haila), a small village near Halkida, Bellou sang as a child in a church choir led by her grandfather, a parish priest. Although she was briefly married in the late '30s, the marriage broke down after she reached her boiling point after months of abuse and threw acid into her husband's face. Arrested and tried in court, she was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Released after serving four months, she relocated to Athens shortly before the onset of World War II. She supported herself, through the war years, as a street musician and took an active role in the Greek resistance, selling copies of a Communist newspaper Rizospastis. Arrested on several occasions, she was repeatedly beaten and imprisoned for her political beliefs. Discovered by Tsitsánis in 1945, Bellou began appearing in Greek nightclubs with Tsitsánis accompanying her singing on piano. She continued to collaborate with Tsitsánis until his death in 1984. Bellou, who recorded the first of many 78 rpm recordings in 1948, struggled during the repressive era of the Greek junta in 1950s and early '60s. Her music, however, remained popular with students and record collectors. Beginning with a series of recordings for the Lyra label in 1966, Bellou reassumed her role as one of Greece's best-loved artists. In 1975, she began working with such top-notch Greek composers as Dionysios Savopoulos. Despite the popularity she enjoyed as a singer, Bellou continued to struggle in her private life. A passionate gambler, she lost several fortunes at secret dice games. Nearly impoverished in her later years, she was aided by the Greek government, which brought her financial relief and helped pay for her extensive medical expenses. Succumbing to throat cancer two days before her 76th birthday, Bellou was provided a State funeral on August 29, 1997.",,,,"Rembetika, Mediterranean Traditions, Greek Folk",,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wpfoxqu5ldde~T1

Of Indian ancestry, but born and raised in Britain, Chandra took lead vocals in the band, which pursued a sort of new wave-tinged raga-rock along the lines of George Harrison's explorations on Beatles tracks like ""Love You To."" The combination yielded an album and an unexpected British hit single, ""Ever So Lonely,"" in the early '80s. Chandra, however, felt limited by the label's pressures for more commercial product, and signed to a small indie label, Indipop, which she felt would offer more freedom for her explorations as a solo artist.","March 14, 1965",,"Waterloo, London, England","Worldbeat, Ambient, Indian Pop, Electronic, Pop/Rock, Indian Subcontinent Traditions, International Fusion, Vocal",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p036/p03649kd316.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:3ifrxqw5ldje~T1

In 1988 another Charlie's Roots lead singer, Chris ""Tambu"" Herbert, began a three-year domination of the Road March as a solo artist. Despite the solo careers of the two, they remain to this day as singers for Charlie's Roots, although as of 1988 they began to release albums under their own names, with the band listed as backup artists. Albums are still released occasionally under the group's name.

Johnny Clegg,"The white, English-speaking, society and Black, African, culture of South Africa was brought together by Johnny Clegg. Together with Sipho Mchunu, a Zulu musician who came to Johannesburg in search of work, Clegg formed South Africa's first multi-racial band, Juluka. In the seven years that they were initally together, the band recorded two platinum and five gold albums and became an international success. Following the group's disbanding in 1986, Clegg continued to blend African music with European pop influences with the band, Savuka. Reunited with Mchunu in the mid-1990s, Clegg reformed Juluka and toured throughout the world as opening act for King Sunny Ade. A native of Lancashire, England, Clegg moved to Africa as a youngster. Although he temporarily lived in Zimbabwe and Zambia, he eventually settled, with his family, in South Africa. Starting guitar at the age of fourteen, Clegg was introduced to South African music when he heard a street musician, Mntonganazo Mzila. Enchanted by what he heard, Clegg apprenticed himself to Mzila for two years, learning the basics of Zulu music and Inhlangwini dancing. Soon after meeting Sipho Mchunu and forming Juluka, Clegg recorded his debut single, ""Waza Friday."" Although racial prejudice in South Africa prevented their first album, Universal Man, from attaining radio airplay, the album became a word of mouth hit. Their second album, African Litany, released in 1981, included the South African hit, ""Impi."" Two years later, Juluka attracted international acclaim for their album, Scatterling. The political climate of South Africa began to take its tollon the group in the mid-1980s. By 1985, Clegg and Mchunu seperated with Mchunu returning to his homeland to work on his farm. Clegg's second band, Savuka, which took its name from the Zulu word meaning ""we have risen"" or ""we have awakened"", took a more pop-minded approach to African music. The group's debut album, Third World Child, sold more than two million copies. Following their second album, Shadow Man, the band embarked on a world tour, opening shows for Steve Winwood in the United States and George Michael in Canada. Savuka reached its peak with its fourth album, Heat, Dust And Dreams, which was nominated for a Grammy in the ""best world music"" category and received a Billboard music award as ""Best World Music Album"".","June 7, 1953",,"Rochdale, Lancashire, England","Pop/Rock, Mbaqanga, Southern African, African Traditions, Worldbeat, Afro-Pop, Zulu",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p035/p03534pktdn.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kifrxqw5ldje~T1

In 1960, Dibango was one of the founding members of the Zairean band African Jazz, with whom he spent five years. World attention came to Dibango with the release in 1972 of Soul Makossa, a work that actually had precious little of the makossa sound in it, and scored later hits with Seventies and Ibida. Dibango's output has been prodigious and multi-faceted. He has worked with musicians as diverse as Fela Kuti, Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, Don Cherry, and the Fania All-Stars. In addition to being one of the leading jazz saxophonists of his generation, Dibango has also run nightclubs, directed orchestras, and started one of the first African musical journals.

They originally called themselves Los Reyes and started out as a gypsy band traveling about playing weddings, festivals, and in the streets. Because they lived so much like gypsies, the band adopted the name the Gipsy Kings. Later, they were hired to add color to posh parties in St. Tropez. Popularity did not come to Los Reyes right away and their first two albums attracted little notice. At this point the Gipsies played traditional, albeit passionate flamenco music punctuated by Tonino's precise guitar playing and Nicolas' exceptional voice. Though they had devoted fans, they still had yet to gain wider recognition until 1986 when they hooked up with visionary producer Claude Martinez who could see that the Kings had the makings of a world-class band.

Cheb Khaled,"Khaled is the poster boy for the modern form of Algerian desert blues known as Raï. Certainly he's been its most successful modern exponent, the first to find success on the international stage. Born Khalidu Hajji Brahim in Oran, the traditional center of Raï, he was attracted to music from an early age, especially to Raï, which was seen at the time of the music of outcasts, drunks, and prostitutes, although he also loved James Brown and the Beatles. He taught himself to play guitar, bass, harmonica, and accordion, releasing his debut disc, ""Trigh Lycee,"" when he was just 14. Leaving home, he began on the peripatetic life of the musician, performing frequently at clubs, parties, and weddings (the only places where Raï was seen as an ""acceptable"" form of entertainment). It was in the early '80s that Cheb (meaning ""young"") Khaled's fortunes changed, when he met up with producer Rachid Baba Ahmed, who was revolutionizing the Raï form by introducing Western electric instruments and studio techniques. Together, they changed the face of the music. Khaled was the right voice at the right time and the addition of drum machines, synthesizers, and guitars took the music to a new generation, even though much of it continued to be censored by the Algerian government, which considered the style subversive. A number of those early tracks can be found on Le Meilleur de Cheb Khaled on Blue Silver.

Ali Akbar Khan,"The son of influential Hindustani musician Allaudin Khan, Ali Akbar Khan was one of the Eastern world's greatest musicians. A master of the sarod, a 25-stringed, lute-like, Indian instrument, Khan brought the Northern Indian classical music to the international stage. A five-time Grammy nominee, Khan was called, by Yehudi Menuhin, ""an absolute genius, the greatest musician in the world."" Tracing his ancestral roots to Mian Tansen, a 16th century musician in the court of Emperor Akbar, Khan began studying music at the age of three. Initially studying vocal music with his father, he studied drums with his uncle, Fakir Aftabuddin. Although he tried playing a wide variety of instruments, he felt most comfortable on the sarod. Training and practicing 18 hours a day, he slowly mastered the instrument. In 1936, he made his public debut during a concert in Allahabad. In the early '40s, Khan became a court musician for the Maharaja of Judhpur. He soon acquired the title ""Ustad"" (master musician).","April 14, 1922",,"Shivpur, Bangladesh","Indian Classical, Raga, World Fusion, Jazz, Bangladeshi, Indian, Indian Subcontinent Traditions",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp200/p295/p29566lrgtv.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fjfexqw5ldse~T1
Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan,"Without doubt the most important qawwal is Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan & Party -- ""Party"" is a generic term for a qawwali ensemble but is also used in Sikhism and to describe some classical music ensembles, for example, shehnai maestro Bismillah Khan & Party. Dubbed Shahen-Shah-e-Qawwali (the Brightest Star in Qawwali), he was born on October 13, 1948, in Lyallpur in the Punjab Province of Pakistan. He made his first recording in 1973 in Pakistan and a number of early EMI (Pakistan) albums jointly billed him with his uncle Mubarak Ali Khan. Since these mainly cassette albums were invariably undated and numerous, it is difficult to place them in any more accurate chronological sequence than catalog-number order. Between 1973 and 1993 his recorded output could only be described as prodigious, with more than 50 album releases to his name on numerous Pakistani, British, American, European and Japanese labels. Heavily over-recorded, blighted with a rash of poppy remix albums or albums with Westernized instrumentation or arrangements, his recorded work is a mire to suck in the uninitiated and their money. Converts, however, do not escape scot-free. Although some releases hint at their nature with coded titles such as Volume 4 Punjabi (Oriental Star CD SR013) from 1990 or Ghazals Urdu (Oriental Star CD SR055) from 1992, the chosen language and style is frequently a matter of conjecture or uncertainty. While the Western market is saturated with his work, the Indian market is supersaturated, and his recorded output is in danger of overwhelming any sense of taste.","October 13, 1948","August 16, 1997","Lyallpur, Pakistan","Qawwali, Indian Subcontinent Traditions",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp500/p522/p52219cecym.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hifqxqw5ldke~T1

Paco de Lucia,"The role of the flamenco guitar has evolved through the playing of Paco de Lucia (born Francisco Sanchez Gomez).

His collaborations have included ten albums with late flamenco vocalist El Camaron de la Isla and work with American pianist Chick Corea and the Guitar Trio, featuring guitarists John McLaughlin, Larry Coryell, and Al DiMeola. His recordings with his sextet, which includes his brothers Ramon and Pepe, include such groundbreaking masterpieces as La Fabulosa Guitarra de Paco de Lucia, Fantasia Flamenca, Fuente y Caudal, Almoraima, and Zyryab. Yet, de Lucia has not completely forsaken traditional flamenco. His 1980 album, Interpreta a Manuel de Falla, paid homage to the classical composer and flamenco enthusiast, while his 1987 album, Siroco, marked a return to pure flamenco. ""I have never lost the roots in my music,"" de Lucia said during a late-'90s interview, ""because I would lose myself.

Baaba Maal,"A superstar in his native Senegal, spiritual pop singer Baaba Maal was not even born to be a performer -- in West African culture, tradition dictates that the ancient griot caste must produce the singers and storytellers, and Maal was born in the city of Podor in 1953 into the fisherman's caste. Despite his parents' insistence that he become a lawyer, he grew up surrounded by music, absorbing both the traditional sounds of the region as well as American R&B and soul, later discovering jazz and blues. As a teen Maal moved to Dakar, joining the 70-piece orchestra Asly Fouta and teaming with his guitarist friend Mansour Seck to form the group Lasli Fouta; during the early '80s, the duo also spent several years in Paris, where they recorded the 1984 album Djam Leelii. Upon returning to Senegal, Maal formed the group Daande Lenol -- literally, ""The Voice of the Race"" -- and began honing a highly distinctive sound fusing traditional African music with elements of pop and reggae; in 1988 he issued the LP Wango, the first in a series of highly successful albums which also included 1991's Baayo, 1992's Lam Toro, and 1994's Firin' in Fouta. In 1998, Maal released Nomad Soul; the first recording on Chris Blackwell's new Palm Pictures label, it featured cameos by Brian Eno, Howie B., and others.

Thomas Mapfumo,"Thomas Mapfumo made revolutionary changes in Zimbabwe's pop-music scene by recording a song for which he'd written his own music. Before Mapfumo, songs in the traditional style were always based on tunes that had been handed down for generations. Mapfumo's music, chimurenga (""music of struggle""), became popular during the civil war against White minority rule, but his popularity made the government unhappy. In 1977 he was sent to a prison camp for subversion. To obtain his release, Mapfumo agreed to perform for the ruling party, but at the concert he sang only his most revolutionary songs. ""I told them that since I'd been in detention, I didn't have time to write new ones."" Mapfumo grew up in the country, went to a British colonial school, and worked as a herd boy, watching over the cattle. After hearing the Beatles and Wilson Pickett in the early 60s, Mapfumo taught himself guitar and started a band that played pop music from African countries as well as Beatles, Rolling Stones, funk, and soul. Mapfumo left Western music behind to form the Acid Band. Their first album, Hokoyo (""Beware""), contained the songs that led to Mapfumpo's detention. After Zimbabwe's liberation in 1978, Mapfumo formed Blacks Unlimited and released Gwindingwe Rine Shumba (""Lion in the Bush""), a joyous celebration of his country's independence.

Astor Piazzolla,"It's not hyperbole to say that Astor Piazzolla is the single most important figure in the history of tango, a towering giant whose shadow looms large over everything that preceded and followed him. Piazzolla's place in Argentina's greatest cultural export is roughly equivalent to that of Duke Ellington in jazz -- the genius composer who took an earthy, sensual, even disreputable folk music and elevated it into a sophisticated form of high art. But even more than Ellington, Piazzolla was also a virtuosic performer with a near-unparalleled mastery of his chosen instrument, the bandoneon, a large button accordion noted for its unwieldy size and difficult fingering system. In Piazzolla's hands, tango was no longer strictly a dance music; his compositions borrowed from jazz and classical forms, creating a whole new harmonic and rhythmic vocabulary made for the concert hall more than the ballroom (which was dubbed ""nuevo tango""). Some of his devices could be downright experimental -- he wasn't afraid of dissonance or abrupt shifts in tempo and meter, and he often composed segmented pieces with hugely contrasting moods that interrupted the normal flow and demanded the audience's concentration. The complexity and ambition of Piazzolla's oeuvre brought him enormous international acclaim, particularly in Europe and Latin America, but it also earned him the lasting enmity of many tango purists, who attacked him mercilessly for his supposed abandonment of tradition (and even helped drive him out of the country for several years).

But while she was a traditionalist to the core, Abdel Wahab believed in learning from Western music. Yet he too was a musical nationalist, renewing rather than diluting Egyptian tradition.

3 Mustaphas 3,"Before the term world music was a twinkling in anyone's eye, 3 Mustaphas 3 were doing it, mixing up different cultures into a gleeful grab bag of music and leaving a heritage that has influenced musicians all over the world. Legend -- their own legend -- has it that the Mustaphas were smuggled out of their mysterious Balkan hometown of Szegerely (where they played at the Crazy Loquat Club) in refrigerators, ending up in England. Not only did they play Balkan music, but a crazy quilt of pieces that they'd first heard on the (extremely eclectic) jukebox at the Crazy Loquat. At great story, but utter rubbish, of course. The truth was more prosaic. In 1982, Ben Mandelson (Hijaz Mustapha), a guitarist and musicologist, began playing with bassist Colin Bass (Sabah Habas Mustapha) and a revolving door of people all of whom assumed bizarre Mustapha relative names, including former Damned member Lu Edmonds, who proved himself adept at the saz and various other ethnic stringed instruments. What they ended up stitching together, both on record and live, drew from Latin, African, Indian, filmi, country, Balkan -- if it was out there, it became a Mustaphas influence. They played frequent shows in Britain and throughout Europe, and even toured the U.S. before releasing their debut album, Shopping, on Mendelson's Globestyle label in 1987. With world music gaining a higher market profile thanks to Paul Simon's successful Graceland, there was a more receptive audience for the strangeness the Mustaphas were purveying, and their touring schedule became more frantic. But they did still find time to record, coming out with the magnificent Heart of Uncle in 1989 and then Soup of the Century a year later. They became a cult act, with an audience that ranged from world music snobs to hippies to punks, all attracted by the band's wicked sense of humor; they had an outright refusal to take anything, especially themselves, seriously. Underscoring it was an excellent, if anarchic, musical sensibility, and respect for the cultures from which they drew their music. The question was, how far could they take it? 1991 brought Friends, Fiends & Fronds, a compilation of alternate mixes, singles, and rare tracks, which filled in some time. And the band continued to tour, although not as heavily as before. By 1992 there was still no ""new"" album, and the group seemed to be giving up the ghost. Certainly a year later, with no album in sight and dates sporadic at best, it seemed as if 3 Mustaphas 3 had gone the way of all flesh. Sabah Habas Mustapha began to focus on his solo career, playing Indonesian dangdut music and writing a massive Asian hit, ""Denpasar Moon,"" in addition to filling the bass slot with aging prog-rockers Camel. Lu Edmonds became a Mekon, touring and recording with them, and Mendelson turned his attention to producing records for Globestyle. However, no one has ever knocked the Mustaphas completely on the head. The band has always maintained that they would reform if the money was right, but no one has yet to come up with a suitable offer. The closest to a reunion has been Mendelson and Edmonds playing together as part of Billy Bragg's backing band, the Blokes, beginning in 1998. Although no gigs were mentioned, Mendelson and Bass did get together in a recording studio in early 2001 to select tracks for a much-belated Mustaphas live album, due to see the light of day in the summer of that year.",1986,,,"World Fusion, Jazz, Worldbeat, Pan-Global, International Fusion",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp300/p310/p31000ohlpe.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:gifixqw5ldhe~T1
Abana Ba Nasery,"The musical traditions of Kenya were brought to the international stage by guitarist/vocalist Shem Tube and his band Abana Ba Nasery. Led by guitarist/vocalist Tube, the group introduced much of the world to the Kenyan tradition of omutibo, an uplifting music produced by two fingerpicked acoustic guitars and three-part vocal harmonies set to a rhythm played on a Fanta soda bottle. One of Kenya's most successful traditional groups of the 1960s and '70s, Abana Ba Nasery disbanded for more than a decade before reuniting in 1991. The revived band reflected the group members' shifting musical influences -- during the group's hiatus, Tube and guitarist/vocalist Justo Osala had performed with an electric banga band, les Bunyore. Their fascination with contemporary music continued following their re-formation. While their debut album, Classic Acoustic Recordings of Western Kenya, showcased the sound of the original acoustic trio, their second effort, Go Ahead, was much more produced. Recorded while the trio was on tour in Europe, the album introduced bagpipes, slide guitar, banjo, and whistle to their sound. Guests on the album included Chopper and Alan Prosser of Oysterband, Hijaz, and 258405Expen$ive Mustapha of 3 Mustaphas 3 and Ron Kavana.

Arrow,"From Montserrat, Arrow got his start as a first-class calypsonian in the traditional Trinidadian style but soon began exploring ways to bring the music to an international level. Always an innovator, he played around with mixing elements of cadence, salsa, and American R&R guitar into his music. In 1983 he experienced his first pan-Caribbean success, ""Hot Hot Hot"" (a song that later became an international hit). Since then he has branched out to include a wider array of world-music elements, from hip-hop to the sounds of various African nations, while concentrating on lyrics that act predominantly as a vehicle to drive the music to a higher frenzy. A late-'80s contract with Island/Mango Records has made him the soca artist most widely distributed and most easily available in the States. His 1992 release, Zombie Soca, was notable for including three songs with social commentary lyrics.

Francis Bebey,"With the sudden heart attack of songwriter, poet, and novelist, Francis Bebey, on May 28, 2001, Cameroon lost one of its most creative artists. The recipient of the prestigious Grand Prix Litteraire De L'Afrique Moudio for his first novel, The Son of Agatha Moudio, in 1968, Bebey went on to scribe several additional novels and scores of poems and songs. Active until shortly before his death, Bebey released two albums of his songs -- Dibiye and Mbira Dance -- to celebrate his 70th birthday. His compositions were covered by John Williams and the Kronos Quartet. According to Stelio Farandjis, secretary general of the High Council of Francophonie, ""(Bebey's) voice, his flute, his guitar, and especially his heart and his faith, enchanted the large ones of this world like the humblest among the humble ones."" Born in the Cameroonian capital city of Douala, Bebey was educated in his homeland and in the United States. He earned a broadcasting license from Studi-ecola de la Radiodiffusion Outre-Mer in Paris. Although he began his career as a radio journalist in Africa and France and worked for the information service of UNESCO from 1961 until 1974, Bebey remained committed to the arts. He continued to perform guitar recitals throughout his years of employment. In 1974, he left his job as a journalist to devote himself to music and writing. Bebey's additional novels include Headstock Ashanti in 1973, King Albert d'Effidi in 1976, and The Minister And Griot in 1992. He published a well-researched examination of African music, Musique Du Afrique, in 1979. Accompanying his vocals on mbira, guitar, and percussion, Bebey was joined by his quartet, which featured Patrick Bebey on vocals, mbira, flute, and percussion; Toups Bebey on saxophone and percussion; and Papa Noel on bass.

In 1988, he became the youngest percussionist to be awarded the title ""Padma Shri"" by the Indian government. Two years later, he recieved the Indo-Ameican award in tribute to his contributions to furthering relations between the United States and India.

Mahlathini,"Simon Nkabinde Mahlathini (nicknamed ""the Lion of Soweto"") came to international attention via the 1985 sampler The Indestructible Beat of Soweto. He began to tour internationally with female singers the Mahotella Queens, although he has been playing and singing his brand of mbaqanga (Zulu pop music, heavily influenced by traditional singing styles) since the early '60s. Mahlathini started singing on street corners, graduated to men's choral music, and went on to form his own smaller group in the mid-'60s. When he ""went electric"" in the mid-'70s, his new sound caused a sensation, and much controversy. With the Mahotella Queens supplying their dynamic backing vocals and fancy dance routines (think of a South African version of the Supremes) and Mahlathini's primal groaning filling the air, you don't have to understand the language to get the message, although the group has occasionally recorded in English. Another part of Mahlathini's success is the backing supplied by West Nkosi and the Makgona Tsohle Band. ""Makgona Tsohle means 'Jack-of-all-trades',"" Nkosi once said. ""Our mbaqanga is a blend of traditional styles with modern instruments, a music anyone can relate to.""

Prince Nico Mbarga,"The death of vocalist and guitarist Prince Nico Mbarga, following a motorcycle accident on June 24, 1997, marked the passing of one of Africa's most influential performers. Although he only recorded one significant hit, ""Sweet Mother,"" in 1976, which sold more than 13 million copies, Mbarga played an important role in the evolution of African music. The son of a Nigerian mother and a Cameroonian father, Mbarga embraced the musical traditions of both cultures. With his soulful vocals set to the light melodies of his acoustic guitar, Mbarga created a unique hybrid of Ibo and Zairean guitar playing and uplifting highlife rhythms. Mbarga's musical approach was inspired by the five years he spent in Cameroon during the Nigerian Civil War of the late '60s. Sharpening his instrumental skills while playing xylophone, conga, drums, and electric guitar in school bands, he made his professional debut as a member of a hotel band, the Melody Orchestra, in 1970. Returning to Nigeria two years later, he formed his own group, Rocafil Jazz, to perform regularly at the Naza Hotel in the eastern Nigerian city of Onitsa. After releasing a disappointing single in 1973, Mbarga and Rocafil Jazz had their first success with their second single, ""I No Go Marry My Papa,"" which became a regional hit. The band's inability to break past their local following, however, resulted in their recording contract being dropped by EMI. The label's decision proved ill-fortuned when the band signed with the Onitsa label and recorded ""Sweet Mother."" Sung in Pidgin English, the song became one of the top sellers in the history of Nigerian music. In the six years that Mbarga and Recotal Jazz remained with Onitsa, 1975 to 1981, they recorded nine albums. Temporarily relocating to England in 1982, Mbarga became known for his flamboyant, '70s glam rock-inspired performances. While he continued to appear with Rocafil Jazz, Mbargar also performed with London-based highlife band the Ivory Coasters and Cameroonian vocalist Louisiana Tilda. Despite launching his own Polydor-distributed record label, upon returning to Nigeria, Mbarga and the original members of Rocafil Jazz separated after several Cameroon-born members were deported. Although he later formed the New Rocafil Jazz Band, Mbarga failed to match his early success.

Born to a poor working-class family in Gran Roi, a small fishing village in Grenada, Sparrow moved to Trinidad at the age of one. Learning to sing in the boy's choir of St. Patrick's Catholic Church, he became the head choirboy. At the age of 14, he formed a steel band to perform at the Carnival, sparking his interest in calypso. Teaching himself to play guitar, Sparrow began to write his own songs. Winning the Carnival competition with ""Jean and Dinah,"" he received a grand prize of 40 dollars. In protest, he wrote a scorching indictment of the Trinidadian music industry, ""Carnival Boycott.""

Oliver Mtukudzi,"Gifted with a deep, gutsy voice and a talent for writing songs that reflect on the daily life and struggles of the people of his homeland, Oliver ""Tuku"" Mtukudzi is one of Zimbabwe's greatest artists. His blending of Southern African music traditions, including mbira, mbaqanga, jit, and the traditional drumming styles of the Korekore, has created such a unique sound that it has been respectfully dubbed ""Tuku music."" While Parade referred to Mtukudzi as ""one of the few genuine innovators on the Zimbabwean music scene,"" Prize Beat proclaimed that ""his music has been instrumental in strengthening our freedom, socially, politically, and economically."" Bonnie Raitt, who has recorded several of his songs, explained, ""The juxtaposition of what Mtukudzi sings about and his raw, imploring, vocal reminds me of Otis Redding, Toots Hibbert, and some of my favorite reggae, an odd pairing of agonizing, thorny lyrics over basically lighthearted music."" Mtukudzi released his debut single, ""Stop After Orange,"" in 1975. Two years later, he began performing with the Wagon Wheels, a group who featured Thomas Mapfumo. His tenure with the band was short-lived, however. By 1979, he had left to pursue a solo career. Taking several of the band's musicians with him, he formed a new group, the Black Spirits. Their debut single, ""Dzandimomotera,"" sold enough copies to qualify for gold record status. As a solo artist, Mtukudzi had his first successes shortly after Zimbabwe declared its independence in 1980. His debut solo album, Africa, included two hits: ""Zimbabwe"" and ""Mazongonyedze."" Mtukudzi has consistently balanced his musical career with his passion for film and drama. In addition to appearing in several documentaries on Zimbabwean music, including the BBC-produced Under African Skies and The Soul of the Mbira, he starred in Jit, the first film featuring an all-Zimbabwean cast. He also played a prominent role in, as well as composed and arranged the soundtrack for, Zimbabwe's second film, Neria. His work earned him a M'Net award for Best Soundtrack of 1992. Mtukudzi subsequently wrote and directed the musical production Was My Child (Plight of Street Children). With the accompaniment of the Black Spirits or the 12-piece supergroup Mahube, Mtukuduzi continued to tour and record. In February 1994, they spent six weeks performing in Austria and Switzerland. That December, they shared a double bill with Lucky Dube for a concert in South Africa. In 1997, Mtukudzi performed in Holland, Germany, Zimbabwe, and South Africa with Mahube, who are comprised of South African musicians. An album, Mahube, was released in October 1998. Mtukudzi reached his commercial peak with the album Tuku Music, which spent 11 weeks at the top of the CMJ New World Music charts. The album has been released in Zimbabwe on the Zimbabwe Music Corporation label, in South Africa on the Sheer Sound label, in Europe on the Label Bleu label, in the United Kingdom on the Connoisseur Collection label, and in North America on the Putumayo World Music label. Shortly after the album's release, Mutukudzi toured the United States and Canada, along with Taj Mahal and Toumani Diabate and Baaba Maal, as part of Africa Fête 1999. A video of Mtukudzi's September 1999 performance in San Francisco was released in February 2000.

Babatunde Olatunji,"Babatunde Olatunji was a virtuoso drummer who became a sensation in the '60s with his albums of traditional Nigerian drumming and chanting. If Olatunji debuted in today's environment, he would be subjected to much tougher scrutiny and evaluation regarding ""authenticity"" than he received in the '60s. His heralded albums, particularly Drums of Passion, weren't quite the innovative event some claimed. They were fine LPs, but also contained a heavy dose of show business and sanitized playing that would be duly noted today, particuarly in the specialist press. Still, his albums reportedly were very influential on John Coltrane. They were among the few international releases to not just make the charts, but remain on them for years. Olatunji didn't make many albums in his prime. From 1964 until 1967 he had four hit LPs. He'd originally come to America in the early '60s to study medicine. Olatunji formed a band of African expatriates mainly as an exercise and way to help each other avoid being homesick. The ensemble scored a hit record and he became a musician. The popularity of Drums Of Passion and More Drums Of Passion predated the '60s black nationalist movement and Afrocentricity of the '80s and '90s. They also had some impact in jazz circles, though they weren't as significant as the Afro-Latin revolution initiated by Mario Bauza, Machito and Chano Pozo. Olatunji resurfaced in the late '80s on the Blue Heron label with The Beat Of My Drum, a release featuring a 17-piece band that included Carlos Santana and Airto Moreira. He subsequently recorded more sessions for Rykodisc, including a digital remix of ""Drums of Passion."" In 1997, He recorded and released Love Drum Talk for the Telarc label.

Before embarking on the Page/Plant tour, Ramzy also worked with Joan Armatrading, Marc Almond, Electric Light Orchestra, Debbie Harry, and Killing Joke. His Pharaoh's Egyptian Ensemble has also recorded over a dozen albums, on which Ramzy attempts to present Egyptian and Arabic music he hopes Western audiences will be able to understand and appreciate through his arrangements, rhythm choices, mixing touches, and tempos.

N. Ravikiran,"A master of the chitra veena, a fretless, 21-stringed, Indian instrument, N. Ravikiran has consistently extended on the musical traditions of India. The only composer to write in each of the 35 talas on the Carnatic music system, Ravikiran is the founder of the International Foundation for Carnatic Music (IFCM) and has written several books on the subject, including Appreciating Carnatic Music and Perfecting Carnatic Music. Many of his articles can be read at www.rec.music.Indian.classical. In addition to recording as a soloist, Ravikiran has collaborated with Martin Simpson (USA), Alizedeh (Iran), Prof. Brian Brown (Australia), and Ustad Sultan Kahn and Girija Devi (India). Together with American blues singer/guitarist Taj Mahal and North Indian musician Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, Ravikiran recorded the groundbreaking world fusion album, Mumtaz Mahal. His innovative playing has garnered acclaim from such Indian musicians as Ravi Shankar, who claimed, ""If you don't believe in God, just look at Ravikiran.""

Cheikha Remitti,"The unrivaled queen of Algerian rai music, Cheikha Rimitti was one of the most beloved and controversial singers of the Islamic world, challenging deeply ingrained notions of sex, politics, and femininity with such candor and ferocity that she was ultimately forced into exile. Born May 8, 1923, in the western Algerian countryside of Tessaa, she was orphaned as an infant and given the name Saadia, spending her adolescence working as a domestic. At age 15, she joined a troupe of traveling musicians known as the Hamadachis and became an accomplished dancer. In time Saadia became a singer (or ""cheikha"") as well, and though illiterate, she possessed a remarkable gift for wordplay, updating traditional Algerian folk songs with contemporary dialogue and slang. Sometime during World War II, she began billing herself as Cheikha Rimitti, adapting the surname from a conversation with a French bartender during which she proved unable to pronounce the word ""remetezz."" As Rimitti's fame grew, so did her notoriety. Her songs captured in vivid detail the struggles faced by Algerian women, with a recurring theme of escape by any means necessary, whether emigration, drinking, or sex. In 1952 Rimitti signed to the Pathe Marconi label to cut her debut single, ""Er-Raï Er-Raï,"" and quickly emerged as a superstar. With the 1954 release of ""Charrak Gattà,"" she became a lightning rod for controversy throughout North Africa for openly advocating sexual liberation and encouraging young women to lose their virginity. When Algeria's first independent government ascended to power in 1962, Rimitti's songs were denounced as ""folklore perverted by colonialism,"" and she was banned from appearing on television and radio. The censorship forced her to relocate to France, where she continued writing and recording to the delight of the fast-growing Algerian immigrant culture. During a brief Algerian tour in 1971, Rimitti was critically injured in an automobile crash that killed three of her backing musicians. The experience resulted in a 1975 pilgrimage to Mecca, after which she abandoned cigarettes and alcohol but continued her musical career. By the 1980s rai was the music of choice for a new generation of disenfranchised Algerians, and Rimitti was hailed as ""La Mamie du Rai"" -- that is, the mother of modern Algerian pop. As artists including Cheb Khaled and Rachid Taha covered her classic compositions, Rimitti's international profile grew exponentially, and she toured as far as Japan and Canada, in 1994 teaming with producer Robert Fripp for the LP Sidi Mansour, widely cited as a watershed in rai's creative evolution. In the summer of 2001, she made her U.S. debut at New York City's Central Park Summerstage, and in 2005 made her first trip back to Algeria in more than a quarter century to record the acclaimed N'ta Goudami. Just two days after performing a sold-out Paris date, Rimitti died of a sudden heart attack on May 15, 2006; she'd celebrated her 83rd birthday a week earlier.","May 8, 1923","May 15, 2006","Tessala, Algeria","Rai, North African, African Traditions, Worldbeat",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp200/p276/p27640ymzht.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wpfoxqu5ld0e~T1

Abdel Gadir Salim,"In a country where nationalist lyrics have been the norm and governmental repression the standard response, Abdel Gadir Salim has stood out as a charismatic, yet resolutely non-political, musician: vibrant, successful, innovative, and widely admired. Abdel Gadir was born in Dilling, in the far west of this country, but started out by writing and performing distinctly urban songs that sounded as if they belonged in Khartoum. He studied both classical European and Arabic music at the Khartoum Institute of Music and started playing oud at the suggestion of a friend. In the early 1970s, he moved away from his city sound and turned back toward the musical culture of his own Kordofan province, playing regional folk songs and celebrations of Kodorfan. Sudan is often called the bridge between Arabia and Africa, and Abdel Gair has taken it as his mission to fuse Arabic and African sounds of the country, taking musical scales and motifs from the former and wild percussion from the latter. The lyrics to his songs (he rarely writes the words himself) address any number of themes ranging from traditional love ballads to educational polemics, although he is always careful to avoid antagonizing the Islamic government. Abdel Gadir sometimes likes to sing alone, but more often than not he keeps the company of his seven-piece backing band, the All-Stars, who count the virtuoso saxophonist Hamid Osman Abdalla among their ranks. A successful musician who has appeared on radio and television, recorded in England, and toured widely, Abdel Gadir still manages to divide his time creatively between music and heading a Sudanese school in Chad.

Oumou Sangare,"In 1990, Wassoulou singer Sangare became a superstar in West Africa with Moussolou, which sold an astonishing 250,000 copies (many more were likely pirated). She received much of her attention for writing and singing lyrics that specifically addressed concerns of women in modern West African society, such as the conflict between marriage and personal freedom; not a shocking subject in the Western world, perhaps, but a pioneering one for the popular music of the region. Western listeners who can't understand the lyrics will be drawn in by her mellifluous vocals and smooth, circular compositions, which use full arrangements without sounding over-produced. Both traditional instruments and electric guitars/basses are prominently used (without getting in each other's way) on her 1993 release Ko Sira, her most widely available recording in the U.S.",1968,,"Bamako, Mali","Afro-Pop, African Folk, Malian Music, Bombara, West African, African Traditions, Desert Blues",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp200/p226/p22611z6234.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0pfrxqu5ldae
Lakshmi Shankar,"Sister-in-law to Ravi Shankar, mother-in-law to L. Subramaniam, Lakshmi Shankar is a remarkable singer. As a young girl she fell under the spell of dance and, encouraged by her forward-thinking mother, she studied Bharat Natyam dancing. She married the scriptwriter Rajendra Shankar, an elder brother of Ravi Shankar, and joined Uday Shankar's artistic circle during the early '40s. Ill-health forced her to give up dancing but, for us, this had the joyful effect of catalyzing her singing career. Around 1946-47 she worked on the historic adaptation of Pandit Nehru's Discovery of India, a work that prompted Nehru to say, ""The ballet's better than my book."" In the 1960s she recorded an album called The Voice of Lakshmi Shankar for World Pacific. Since then she has recorded widely in varying capacities and styles including Tamil folk songs, Hindu devotional songs of all sorts, film work (including the soundtrack to Gandhi) and for television documentaries.

Chitravina Ravikiran plays the chitravina while others have vina, violin, clarinet or even fiddle as calling cards. And the Tamil composer Cook Srivivasalu gained his name through working as cook at the temple of Sri Minakshi! U. Srinivas's father, Satayanarayana Raju, taught him initially and his natural talent soon blossomed. He made his first public appearance at the age of nine. He proved a revelation and was hailed as a child prodigy. Srinivas was the first to use the mandolin in Indian Karnatic classical music. He has recorded extensively and his recorded output traces a rising graph of excellence. His instrument has little to do with Neapolitan or flatback mandolin models. His is a five-string solid body electric model more akin to the electric instrument played by the American mandolinist Tiny Moore than traditional acoustic models. U.

L. Subramaniam,"A gifted South Indian counterpart of Jean-Luc Ponty on the electric violin, and endlessly curious about all kinds of music, Subramaniam has been a pioneer in exploring intelligent fusions between European classical music, American jazz, rock, and South Indian music. His father, a master Indian violinist, and mother, who played the Indian vina, were his first musical influences, and after abandoning a career in medicine, he formed a violin trio with his two brothers while still in India. He toured America and Europe with Ravi Shankar and ex-Beatle George Harrison in 1974, made his first fusion album in Copenhagen (Garland), and wrote material for Stu Goldberg and Larry Coryell in 1978. He settled in the Los Angeles area in the late '70s in order to earn a doctorate in Western music at the California Institute of the Arts, where he also taught South Indian music. He led a group with Coryell, George Duke, and Tom Scott in the 1980s, and recorded several fascinating LPs for Milestone -- including an LP with Stephane Grappelli -- that fused classical music, electric and acoustic jazz, and South Indian music. Subramaniam has also written works for classical orchestras; his Violin Concerto juxtaposes naïve Hollywood-ish romantic music with South Indian instruments and structures.

Touré Kunda,"An infectious blend of African, Latin, Brazilian, reggae, and pop rhythms have made Toure Kunda one of the most successful bands to come out of Senegal. Their album Paris Ziguinchor sold more than a quarter of a million copies while their guest harmonies helped to turn Africa Bamba into one of the most exciting songs on Santana's nine Grammy award-winning 1999 album, Supernatural. Initially based in the Casamance region of southwest Senegal, Toure Kunda was formed by brothers Amadou, Ismael, and Sixu Toure to perform at the traditional Senegalese coming of age ceremony, Djamba Dong. They added the name ""Kunda"" from the Sorinka word for ""family."" Although they played indigenous African instruments -- including kora, balafon, and sabar -- at first, Toure Kunda increasingly adopted western instruments including guitars, electric bass, and synthesizer. Relocating to Paris in 1979, Toure Kunda continued to stir audiences with a mbalax and reggae-influenced dance music that they dubbed ""djambaadong."" The group performed for Nelson Mandela during his first trip to France in 1982. Toure Kunda's performance for Mandela marked one of the original group's final shows. A year later, oldest brother and bandleader Amadou Toure was struck with a fatal heart attack.

Ali Farka Touré,"One of the most internationally successful West African musicians of the '90s, Ali Farka Touré was described as ""the African John Lee Hooker"" so many times that it probably began to grate on both Touré's and Hooker's nerves. There is a lot of truth to the comparison, however, and it isn't exactly an insult.

He often sang as well, and employed accompanists on guitar, the toumbeleki hand drum, and the baglamas (a stringed instrument which is a member of the bouzouki family). His lyrics are often bold, with direct references to hashish smoking and streetwalkers, although he didn't confine himself to those subjects, even releasing a patriotic number when Greece was on the verge of being taken over by Italian forces.

A product of the folk music department at Helsinki's Sibelius Academy, Värttinä formed in the early '80s, its 21 original members all previously associated with an area youth group. Over time their ranks gradually slimmed down, and by the early '90s the group primarily consisted of vocalists Sari Kaasinen, Mari Kaasinen, Kirsi Kahkonen, and Sirpa Reiman, backed by an ever-revolving lineup of backing musicians.",1983,,"Raakkyla, Kaarelia, Finland","International, Nordic Traditions, Finnish Folk, Worldbeat",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p066/p06636psxi7.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wxfqxqq5ldje~T1
Papa Wemba,"With his dynamic vocals and flamboyant personality, Papa Wemba (born Jules Shungu Wembadio Pene Kikumba) played an essential role in the evolution of Central African music. Respectfully known as ""the King of Rhumba,"" Wemba successfully fused African traditions with Western pop and rock influences. A co-founder of Zaiko Langa Langa in 1970, he went on to international attention as the leader of Isife Lokole in 1974, and Viva La Musica since 1976. According to publicity materials for the Womadelaide festival, Wemba ""creates wonderfully infectious music, combining the sophistication of a Paris nightclub with the vibe of an African open-air concert."" While www.fyiucalgary.com proclaimed that ""his voice is gold and his music makes you want to dance,"" www.afropop.com declared that he offered ""just the right balance between traditional African music and Western pop."" Born in the Kinshasa region of what was then the Belgian Congo and now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Wemba was taught that he was descended from a long line of BaTetela warrior chieftains. His mother, a professional mourner who sang at funeral wakes, had a profound influence on his singing. He recalled in a late-'90s interview, ""If mother was still alive, I would be rich in words and rich in melodies. She was my first teacher and my first audience."" Wemba didn't begin singing until joining the choir of a Roman Catholic Church after the death of his father, a chief of customs, in 1966. The experience sharpened his abilities to sing in minor keys. Helping to form Zaiko Langa Langa in 1969, Wemba remained with the group for four years. During that time, the group went from playing American R&B to focusing on traditional Zairian dance music. Their hits included several Wemba-penned tunes, such as ""Pauline,"" ""C'est la Vérité,"" ""Chouchouna,"" and ""Liwa Ya Somo."" Leaving Zaiko Langa Langa in 1974, Wemba formed the first bands of his own, Isife Lokole and Yoka Lokole. Both groups used the lokole, a hollow tree trunk played with two sticks, as a rhythmic foundation. Moving to the village of Molokai in the center of Kinshasa's Matonge district in 1977, Wemba formed his most successful group, Viva la Musica. Their music continued to reflect an authenticity campaign launched by President Mobutu. Wemba appeared frequently on state-sponsored television, talking about the influence of traditional Zairian music and the importance of the authenticity campaign. From the beginning, Viva La Musica's reputation was built as much on their passion for designer clothes as their music. www.afropop.org described the band's garb as ""baggy, pleated trousers, hemmed above shiny brogues, and hair clipped close at the sides."" Fans inspired by the band's style of dress began dressing similarly and were known as ""La Sape,"" taken from the expression, ""La Société des Ambienceus et ces Personnes D'Élégance."" Viva la Musica was extremely popular among the Congo's youth. Their first year climaxed with the Kinshasa newspaper Elima naming the band best orchestra, Wemba best singer, and their single, ""Mère Supérieure,"" best song. Over the next three years, the group continued to record hit singles, including ""Moku Nyon Nyon,"" ""Nyekesse Migue'l,"" and ""Cou Cou Dindon."" Determined to capture a European following, Wemba and Viva La Musica vocalist Rigo Star took a six-month sabbatical from the band in 1979 to join Tabu Ley Rochereau's group, Afrisa International. Relocating to Paris in the early '80s, Wemba formed a second version of Viva la Musica. While this group took a more Westernized approach, the original band continued to perform indigenous-based music. Wemba explained, ""My original group is there for me Zairian fans who come to hear typical African sounds but when I decided to be a singer with an international name, I formed another group to appeal to a different public."" Wemba appeared in the late-'80s musical revue Africa Oye!, and toured as the opening act for Peter Gabriel's Secret World tour in 1993. He received a best artist Kora award at the first All-African music awards ceremony three years later. Wemba has continued to fuse the musical traditions of his homeland and Western pop. His 1995 album Emotion was produced by Stephen Hague of Pet Shop Boys, Erasure, and New Order fame.
