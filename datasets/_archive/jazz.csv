Louis Armstrong,"Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an ""inventive"" cornet and trumpet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence on jazz, shifting the music's focus from collective improvisation to solo performers. With his distinctive gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also greatly skilled at scat singing, or vocalizing using syllables instead of actual lyrics.",4-Aug-01,6-Jul-71,New Orleans,jazz trumpet vocals dixieland New Orleans,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Louis_Armstrong_restored.jpg/250px-Louis_Armstrong_restored.jpg,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong
Count Basie,"Widely regarded as one of the most important jazz bandleaders of his time, Basie led his popular Count Basie Orchestra for almost 50 years. Many notable musicians came to prominence under his direction, including tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry ""Sweets"" Edison and singers Jimmy Rushing and Joe Williams. Basie's theme songs were ""One O'Clock Jump"" and ""April In Paris"".",21-Aug-04,26-Apr-84,new york,jazz big band swing piano band leader,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Count_Basie_in_Rhythm_and_Blues_Revue.jpg/220px-Count_Basie_in_Rhythm_and_Blues_Revue.jpg,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Basie
John Coltrane,"Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and later was at the forefront of free jazz. He was prolific, making about fifty recordings as a leader during his recording career, and appeared as a sideman on many other albums, notably with trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. As his career progressed, Coltrane's music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension. His second wife was pianist Alice Coltrane, and their son Ravi Coltrane is also a saxophonist.",23-Sep-26,17-Jul-67,Philadelphia,jazz tenor saxophone,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/John_Coltrane_1960.jpg/220px-John_Coltrane_1960.jpg,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane
Cannonball Adderley,"One of the great alto saxophonists, Cannonball Adderley had an exuberant and happy sound that communicated immediately to listeners. His intelligent presentation of his music (often explaining what he and his musicians were going to play) helped make him one of the most popular of all jazzmen.",15-Sep-28,8-Aug-75,"Tampa, FL",jazz saxophone bop ,,
Mose Allison,"Not unlike his namesake, Luther Allison, pianist Mose Allison has suffered from a ""categorization problem,"" given his equally brilliant career. Although his boogie-woogie and bebop-laden piano style is innovative and fresh sounding when it comes to blues and jazz, it is as a songwriter that Allison really shines. Allison's songs have been recorded by the Who (""Young Man Blues""), Leon Russell (""I'm Smashed""), and Bonnie Raitt (""Everybody's Cryin' Mercy""). Other admirers include Tom Waits, John Mayall, Georgie Fame, the Rolling Stones, and Van Morrison. But because he's always played both blues and jazz, and not one to the exclusion of the other, his career has suffered. As he himself admits, he has a ""category"" problem that lingers to this day. ""There's a lot of places I don't work because they're confused about what I do,"" he explained in a 1990 interview in Goldmine magazine. Despite the lingering confusion, Allison remains one of the finest songwriters in 20th century blues.",11-Nov-27,,"Tippo, MS",jazz vocal piano songwriter blues,,
Chet Baker,"Chet Baker was a primary exponent of the West Coast school of cool jazz in the early and mid-'50s. As a trumpeter, he had a generally restrained, intimate playing style and he attracted attention beyond jazz for his photogenic looks and singing. But his career was marred by drug addiction.",23-Dec-29,13-May-88,"Yale, OK",jazz cool west coast jazz trumpet vocals,,

King Sunny Ade,"King Sunny Ade is the undisputed king of juju music, the dance-inspiring hybrid of western pop and traditional African music with roots in the guitar tradition of Nigeria. Although he's yet to equal the success that he enjoyed with his early-1980s albums and American tours, Ade and his band, His African Beats, continue to weave an infectious blend of electric guitars, synthesizers and multi-layered percussion.",20-Sep-46,,"Oshogbo, Nigeria","juju, afro-pop, african traditions, highlife, worldbeat, afro-beat",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp400/p471/p47134ajqhx.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kifixqw5ldhe
Mahmoud Ahmed,"n Ethiopia the word is ""eskeusta,"" which roughly translated means ecstasy, more specifically it is a shaking sensation that begins at one's shoulders, quivering down the spine and into the legs and feet. And of all of the great male vocalists that Ethiopia has produced (don't laugh, there have been quite a few) none are able to create eskeusta better than Mahmoud Ahmed.",18-May-41,,"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","world fusion, jazz, worldbeat, east african, african traditions",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drP300/P322/P32255SBXST.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aifixqw5ldhe
