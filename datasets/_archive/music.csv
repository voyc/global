Louis Armstrong,"Louis Armstrong was the first important soloist to emerge in jazz, and he became the most influential musician in the music's history. As a trumpet virtuoso, his playing, beginning with the 1920s studio recordings made with his Hot Five and Hot Seven ensembles, charted a future for jazz in highly imaginative, emotionally charged improvisation. For this, he is revered by jazz fans. But Armstrong also became an enduring figure in popular music, due to his distinctively phrased bass singing and engaging personality, which were on display in a series of vocal recordings and film roles.","August 4, 1904","July 6, 1971","New Orleans, LA","Dixieland, Early Jazz, New Orleans Jazz, Vocal Jazz, Vocal, Swing, Traditional Pop, Jazz Instrument, Trumpet Jazz",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drP000/P007/P00735M9K4C.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kcftxqq5ld0e~T1,louis-armstrong
Count Basie,"Count Basie was among the most important bandleaders of the swing era. With the exception of a brief period in the early '50s, he led a big band from 1935 until his death almost 50 years later, and the band continued to perform after he died. Basie's orchestra was characterized by a light, swinging rhythm section that he led from the piano, lively ensemble work, and generous soloing. Basie was not a composer like Duke Ellington or an important soloist like Benny Goodman. His instrument was his band, which was considered the epitome of swing and became broadly influential on jazz.","August 21, 1904","April 26, 1984","Red Bank, NJ","Big Band, Blues, Piano Blues, Swing",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp000/p028/p02821de8u7.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fifuxqt5ld6e~T1,count-basie
King Sunny Ade,"King Sunny Ade is the undisputed king of juju music, the dance-inspiring hybrid of western pop and traditional African music with roots in the guitar tradition of Nigeria. Although he's yet to equal the success that he enjoyed with his early-1980s albums and American tours, Ade and his band, His African Beats, continue to weave an infectious blend of electric guitars, synthesizers and multi-layered percussion.","September 20, 1946",,"Oshogbo, Nigeria","juju, afro-pop, african traditions, highlife, worldbeat, afro-beat",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drp400/p471/p47134ajqhx.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kifixqw5ldhe,king-sunny-ade
Mahmoud Ahmed,"In Ethiopia the word is ""eskeusta,"" which roughly translated means ecstasy, more specifically it is a shaking sensation that begins at one's shoulders, quivering down the spine and into the legs and feet. And of all of the great male vocalists that Ethiopia has produced (don't laugh, there have been quite a few) none are able to create eskeusta better than Mahmoud Ahmed.","May 18, 1941",,"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","world fusion, jazz, worldbeat, east african, african traditions",http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/pic200/drP300/P322/P32255SBXST.jpg,http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aifixqw5ldhe,mahmoud-ahmed
