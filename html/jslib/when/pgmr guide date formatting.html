Lower-case for date symbols; upper-case for time symbols.
All numbers 
Always use leading zero for units smaller than YEAR.
All dates are stored internally in UTC.
When we say "date", we usually mean "datetime".
Our scale is infinite in both directions.

The percent of seconds could be any number of N symbols.
We are using three NNN as a fixed limit because that is the maximum precision of Javascript Date object.

So why are we using discrete time-levels?  This is a temporary coding convenience only.
Why are we building a general purpose system?  We're not.  We're preparing for Voyc's future.
No, perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I should insist on years-per-inch as time level.
Wait a minute.  If I abandon the decimal year concept, do I also abandon years per inch, and go instead with microseconds per inch?
Microseconds per inch is not practical.  Numbers get too big.
We're using decimal degrees for the map.
So why not use decimal years for the timeline.
It's ok to use decimal years for level, because that is arbitrary.
It is NOT ok to use decimal years for a point
	1. it's not accurate, especially at nanosecond levels
	2. it varies from year to year.  Leap years have smaller values for each unit.

Timeout.  
Decimal years and H:M:S.N are equally accurate systems.  They just have different purposes.
Like the geographic map.  Degrees, minutes and seconds, and percentage seconds are equ
The difference is, on the geographic map, the number of minutes in a degree, and the number of degrees in a circle never change.
On the time map, the year varies in length in terms of seconds.

For drawing a timeline at precision year and above, either system works.
For drawing a timeline at precision below year, because 1776 is a leap year, technically
	at 1776 Jan 1 00:00:00, the seconds before that point are wider than the seconds after
Technically, if we base the drawing on seconds, years would get longer or shorter.
Minutes and seconds are the sticking point.  Milliseconds are ok.

We can use either system for drawing the timeline.
Both have sticking points when a year crosses playhead.
Similarly, displaying on the map gets sticky when the IDL is on screen.


Note degrees per inch and years per inch are mixing scales.
degree, inch and year are all different.
Inch could be cm maybe.
a Year is a unit of 1 rotation around the sun.
A second is not a division 

Both the geographic map and the time map are based on a circle.
The time map is based on three circles: the revolution around the sun, the rotation of the earth, and the clock face.
On a geographic map a second is a division of the total circle, and varies in length depending on latitude.
On a time map, the second retains a constant length, and the number of seconds in the circle vary as necessary.
Another difference between geographic and time maps: the time map has a much longer scale.
Earth geography is confined to 360 degrees in each dimension.



Entering dates.

For programmers:
Dates entered with precision YEAR and lesser, are entered in Local.
Dates entered with precision YEAR and greater, are entered in UTC.  Hours and minutes NOT added for locale.

For Users:
Dates are entered on calendar and clock, like Android.
Or, large-scale dates are entered on a new control offering BC, AD, scales, etc.
Or, by dragging dot or bar on timeline.
