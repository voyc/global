Vedic Yoga

It is clear from what has been said thus far that Vedic Yoga—which could also be called Archaic Yoga—was intimately connected with the ritual life of the ancient Indians. It revolved around the idea of sacrifice as a means of joining the material world with the invisible world of the spirit. In order to perform the exacting rituals successfully, the sacrificers had to be able to focus their mind for a prolonged period of time. Such inner focusing for the sake of transcending the limitations of the ordinary mind is the root of Yoga.

When successful, the Vedic yogi was graced with a “vision” or experience of the transcendental reality. A great master of Vedic Yoga was called a “seer”—in Sanskrit rishi. The Vedic seers were able to see the very fabric of existence, and their hymns speak of their marvelous intuitions, which can still inspire us today.

COUP LEADER HEADS INVESTMENT BOARD

The military has moved swiftly to revive the economy, and has given itself two months to clear a backlog of applications from local and foreign investors to spend more than $21 billion on projects in Thailand. [ID:nL3N0OJ1PI]

The backlog arose because Yingluck's caretaker government lacked the power to appoint a new team to run the Board of Investment to replace executives whose term ended in October.

7 Jun 2014 General Prayuth declared himself the head of the Board of Investment, a position typically held by the prime minister, and plans quick approval of 21 Billion backlog in investment projects from local and foreign investors.

Protests begin?
  
7 May 2014 A court finds Yingluck guilty of abuse of power and steps down as prime meinister.

Feb 2014 Protesters disrupted the vote, the election was annulled, and Yingluck's crippled caretaker government was forced to limp on.

Dec 2014 Yingluck dissolved parliament and called a February election in a bid to end anti-government protests.
