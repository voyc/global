three styles, with hover style for each 
	background bar (no background dots)
	foreground dot
	foreground bar
	foreground bar+dot

background bar
normal                           hovered
color pastel                     no change
border none                      real color (not pastel) 
text none                        headline
height computed                  fixed to hold text
top computed                     revise upward centered

foreground bar
normal                           hovered
color pastel                     white
border thin, shadow              increase shadow depth?
text headline                    headline
height fixed                     no change
top computed                     revise upward same as shadow depth

foreground dot
normal                           hovered
color none                       white
border none                      thin, shadow

color real                       white
border this, shadow              increase shadow depth

top computed                     revise upward


set opaque is applying to texts

disqualify overlaps of foreground

Time level at years or greater, show background. Else, no background.

mouseover of background not working
design issue: background text bleeds through foreground text
some name bars overlap each other
name bars are red

Trojan War
	map dot is not dislayed
	normal display should be with drop shadow
		also give it rounded corners
		and correct color, not default red
		will have a dot to match the dot on the map
	hover display should do something else: border? white? color brightener?

rename row and stream to fgd, bkd

isolate and document which attributes are in class, and which are in javascript

when creating foreground timebar
	set top, height, zindex

on hover
	set zindex to a fixed value, always used for the hovered timebar

on hover off
	reset zindex to its original value

vertical rules are embarassing, put them in separate div, experiment with putting them on top or in back or inbetween 

is it possible to test and develop in the testTimeline file?
	is that really any easier at this point?
	or is it good just to isolate code?

why do we have a record with id=0, forebear=0?  does it have something to do with user table?

Handle forebear.

counts by datatype where forebear <> 0
2	466
3	99
6	7
7	37

counts by datatype where forebear = 0
2	56
3	117
6	20
8	22
10	2
11	279363

row drawing algorithm	
	draw forebears
	draw all rows that use a forebear
	call out overlaps
	these are finite, do them all now
	one fix for overlaps may be to collect geoms
	
	draw non-forebears
	
	collapse
	check begin and end of each row
	if not on screen, move the row, hide the row, make it not display
	
	interleave
	combine rows when doing so would not cause an overlap
	each row still retains its identity
	? on future dataready, a forebear row may be extended
		? in which case it would no longer be interleavable in the same way
	
	combine by headline
	combine adjacent bars with identical headline into a single bar
	test case: Assyria, 13567
	13576
	
select headline, editstatus, id, forebear, datatype, maptype, timetype, timebegin, timeend, color, maplvllo, maplvlhi, timelvllo, timelvlhi 
from fpd.fpd 
where headline = 'Etruscans'
order by timebegin, timeend





update fpd.fpd set color=5, timebegin=-520 where id=14481;
delete from fpd.fpd where id = 14479;

X7 = Phrygia

--------------
Handle editstatus 3,4,5. Includes Huns, Fatimids, Mamelukes aka Marmelukes.
select id, headline, forebear, editstatus, datatype, timebegin, timeend, maplvllo, maplvlhi, timelvllo, timelvlhi, timetype , maptype, geometrytype(the_geom), st_npoints(the_geom)
from fpd.fpd 
where editstatus in (3,4,5)
order by headline, editstatus, datatype, timebegin, timeend
----------------

in timeline drawing
	first, select and sort by forebear, and put all on the same row/stream

options:
	Use merge algorithms during dispatch
	Show developer info in detail window

option:
	time panned - incremental read, plus merge
	time zoomed - replace
	map panned - merge
	map zoomed - merge
	on search - replace

detail window
	show begin-end pair, depending on timetype
	when development option on, show types and levels
internals
	display of id numbers
		bind hover and select handlers
-------------

Offline
	update programmer's guide 
	add design guidelines from below in this doc

Remove direct access to voyc.voyc.* variables
	Now and World commands
		Event: location_loaded, passing bounds object, named location
		pub: Dashboard
		sub: Map, Timeline

	layout.switchPanel: remove this capability, build new window for meta screens
		Layout, Detail, Dashboard

Separate window for options vs internals, 
	after we have determined need for public options.

Add accordian dropdown for the multiple divs in the Internals Window

next goal: a nice greek provincial map
	map: remove Carthaginians 14777, check the maplevel
	timeline:
		background of political boundaries
			see how many rows we have
			set height of row so all will fit
			eliminate title when less than n pixels in height
			on hover, show the timebar at normal height
		foreground of persons, events, works

what about Persian War, and by extension, WW1?
	what if we use polygon with dashed outline and no fill?
	require click exactly on the border, not the fill (possible?)
		use polyline, with Icon Sequence

options
	timeline
		1. use fixup only for points
		2. assign timebars in a way that they do not overlap
		3. after a user option, do a complete redraw with server call, like scroll
		3A. Add options button to redraw as if scroll happened
		mark and count while drawing
			qualified
			offscreen because of time range
			offscreen because of fixup
			offscreen because of user request
			offscreen because there is no vertical space left on the timeline
		when a map polygon is not on the timeline centerline
			when the timebar is hovered: show the outline 
		when a map polygon is not on the timeline due to inadequate vertical space
			when the polygon is hovered: show a phantom timebar somewhere on the timeline 
	timeline + data
		Carthaginians 14777 map polygon overlaps other polygons 
			so we cannot click on any underneath
		datatype: separate persons and works, combine persons and greek persons

what to display: maplevel, timelevel, magnitude
	server-side selection: rough approximation
	client-side drawing: based on available timeline space
		would be nice if we could get everything to display?
		or to give an icon that indicates zoom here for more

How to display timeshape
	shape and color: determined by timetype, color
	which row to put it on: determined by forebear, begin, end, magnitude
	whether to show it: magnitude
	combining bars: headline
	note: reference concept is obsolete

How to display mapshape
	shape and color: maptype, color
	note: reference concept is obsolete

1. Clearup datatype, maptype, timetype, editstatus
	
diagnostics
	optional show complete record in detail window
		include ms, ts, q, disqualified by timeline
	show array of counts by datatype, before and after timeline disqualification
	allow story select without error for missing ms or ts object

ancient greece
	provincial political boundaries
		all on map, none on timeline ?
	persons
		on map and timeline
	works
		on map and timeline
		

2. Clearup leveling criteria
		maplevel, timelevel, magnitude

	select datatype,timelvllo,timelvlhi,maplvllo,maplvlhi,min(magnitude), max(magnitude), count(*)
	from fpd.fpd
	group by datatype,timelvllo,timelvlhi,maplvllo,maplvlhi
	order by datatype,timelvllo,timelvlhi,maplvllo,maplvlhi

Timeline zoom out
	default dot color to red
	set color for other bibids
	assign to rows, do not overlap spans
	handle forebear
	handle identical headlines
	handle maptype ?: 
		Alexander the Great appears on Timeline with red font, 
		detail popup appears on map, but shape does not
		select *
			from fpd.fpd
			where id in (13885,14680)

	leveling criteria
		add back map and timeline levels
		add new logic for displaying sets of map polygons?
		
Map
	on hover
		show the mapshape even if not on timeline centerline
	greek personages are maptype 6, no points, error on hover
		what mt is Alexander the Great? (see above)

Detail
	remove nophoto image
	replace with a single pixel dot image (so I always know)

Dispatch: algorithms
	test replace vs incremental reads
	handle skipped block
		implement xhr, origin
		timeout, retry 
		issues
			dashboard notification
			remove and re-add request array
	handle readData-dataReady overlap
	late packet discarded, followed by "ran out of bars"
	panning algorithm leaves holes when zoombar is used
		consider dragging of both scroller and zoombar
		read data on first drag
		readdata on drop has too wide range, too low max
	first readdata has too high maxrows, because data found covers only half the span

Dispatch: data issues
	many records with null the_geom
	DemocracyNow data has points in bogus positions
	would be excellent if we could remove map and timeline levels from qualify criteria
		try removing it for awhile and see what happens
	what are the datatypes?
		see notes in dispatch.js

Developer Notes

Production 
	www.voyc.com (uses index.php)

Debugging
	www.voyc.com/index.html

Querystring parameters
	?debug=1 (allow popups)  (popup from file: is evidently disallowed in chrome)
	?history=1

database has two addins:
	postGIS
	Tsearch2 - full-text search

---------------------------------

feature requests
	new graphics for vote up and down, like facebook like
	remove vote down, and do likes only
	show a spinning wheel when detail photo is loading, instead of previous story's photo
	support touch screen 
	forward/back on menu items

design guidelines
	horizontal timeline.  can be resized vertically but does not scroll vertically.
	avoid calls to voyc.voyc.* variables, use event instead 

unique features to show off:
	scalable display, fits all window sizes
	drag the one button to change 3 window sizes all at once
	only one page, all ajax
	ongoing updates for four years
	zoomable timeline
	login, register
	voting
	algorithms for determining which items to show based on importance or relevance, and depending on available space 
	dot intensity shows location in time: current, past, future
	filter vs search
	edit
	post
	publish feed
	upload file
	email 

----------------------------------

tasks to assign to new team, to bring them up to speed:

build retries and on-failure messaging into appendScript
	- appendScript is required for loading GMapApi asynchronously
	- is it possible to catch an error
		the console shows these errorswith the filename I tried to append
			net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT
			net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED  

build local testing into Xhr, using "origin" specification
	- after this is done, consider using xhr for Dispatch.read()

Fix iframe upload_target.  Currently it causes onload to fire twice.
	(If we re-implement file upload.)
